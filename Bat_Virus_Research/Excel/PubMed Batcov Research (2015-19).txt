AB  - The four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 
      contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections 
      in adults and children. While their clinical representation resembles that of 
      many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host 
      associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past 
      human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an 
      origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four 
      viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate 
      from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and 
      -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. 
      HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as 
      cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible 
      ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic 
      recorded historically at the end of the 19th century. New data suggest that 
      HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. This scenario provides important 
      ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of 
      the MERS coronavirus.

LID - 10.3390/v6083363 [doi]
AB  - Canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) is an alphacoronavirus infecting dogs that is 
      closely related to enteric coronaviruses of cats and pigs. While CCoV has 
      traditionally caused mild gastro-intestinal clinical signs, there are increasing 
      reports of lethal CCoV infections in dogs, with evidence of both gastrointestinal 
      and systemic viral dissemination. Consequently, CCoV is now considered to be an 
      emerging infectious disease of dogs. In addition to the two known serotypes of 
      CCoV, novel recombinant variants of CCoV have been found containing spike protein 
      N-terminal domains (NTDs) that are closely related to those of feline and porcine 
      strains. The increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel 
      CCoVs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene 
      that can occur during infection by more than one CCoV type in the same host.

AB  - Bats are speculated to be reservoirs of several emerging viruses including 
      coronaviruses (CoVs) that cause serious disease in humans and agricultural 
      animals. These include CoVs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and 
      severe acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Bats that are naturally infected or 
      experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease. These 
      observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely 
      reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs. In this review, we follow the CoV 
      outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats. We review studies that 
      have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow 
      them to harbor CoVs without severe disease. We speculate about future studies 
      that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and 
      factors that enable these viruses to "jump" from bats to other mammals. We hope 
      that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently 
      exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to 
      overcome present limitations.

AB  - Zoonotic transmission of novel viruses represents a significant threat to global 
      public health and is fueled by globalization, the loss of natural habitats, and 
      exposure to new hosts. For coronaviruses (CoVs), broad diversity exists within 
      bat populations and uniquely positions them to seed future emergence events. In 
      this review, we explore the host and viral dynamics that shape these CoV 
      populations for survival, amplification, and possible emergence in novel hosts.

AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Deltacoronavirus) 
      is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute 
      diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. 
      PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with 
      co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, 
      genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden 
      emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, 
      since 2013-2014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing 
      a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US 
      PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the 
      entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary 
      sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause 
      acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) 
      that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the 
      potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis 
      of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to 
      control viral diarrheas in US swine. Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) 
      strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other 
      laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to 
      evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates TC-PDCoV as a potential 
      vaccine candidate strain. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and 
      epidemiology of epidemic PDCoV strains is currently needed to prevent and control 
      the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review 
      focuses on the etiology, cell culture isolation and propagation, molecular 
      epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.

AB  - Infections with bat-origin coronaviruses have caused severe illness in humans by 
      'host jump'. Recently, novel bat-origin coronaviruses were found in pigs. The 
      large number of mutations on the receptor-binding domain allowed the viruses to 
      infect the new host, posing a potential threat to both agriculture and public 
      health.

AB  - The recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) highlights the 
      need to engineer new methods for expediting vaccine development against emerging 
      diseases. However, several obstacles prevent pursuit of a licensable MERS 
      vaccine. First, the lack of a suitable animal model for MERS complicates the in 
      vivo testing of candidate vaccines. Second, due to the low number of MERS cases, 
      pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to pursue MERS vaccine production 
      as the costs of clinical trials are high. In addition, the timeline from bench 
      research to approved vaccine use is 10 years or longer. Using novel methods and 
      cost-saving strategies, genetically engineered vaccines can be produced quickly 
      and cost-effectively. Along with progress in MERS animal model development, these 
      obstacles can be circumvented or at least mitigated.

TI  - A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human 
      emergence.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of 
      cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine 
      the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently 
      circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse 
      genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the 
      spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results 
      indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone 
      can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin 
      converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells 
      and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. 
      Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus 
      in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based 
      immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both 
      monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from 
      infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these 
      findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 
      recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in 
      vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses 
      currently circulating in bat populations.

AB  - Cross-species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs poses a 
      marked threat to human and animal health (1) . Bats have been recognized as one 
      of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a 
      coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was 
      responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS) (2-10) . Here we provide virological, epidemiological, 
      evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, 
      swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent 
      that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China 
      that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the 
      outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS 
      pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98% sequence 
      identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong 
      province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) 
      that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking 
      similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, 
      ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of 
      identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future 
      outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.

AB  - Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, 
      in the family Coronaviridae, of the Nidovirales order and outbreaks of porcine 
      epidemic diarrhoea (PED) were first recorded in England in the 1970s. 
      Intriguingly the virus has since successfully made its way around the globe, 
      while seemingly becoming extinct in parts of Europe before its recent return from 
      Northern America. In this review we are re-evaluating the spread of PEDV, its 
      biology and are looking at lessons learnt from both failure and success. While a 
      new analysis of PEDV genomes demonstrates a wider heterogeneity of PEDV than 
      previously anticipated with at least five rather than two genotypes, biological 
      features of the virus and its replication also point towards credible control 
      strategies to limit the impact of this re-emerging virus.

TI  - Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike 
      antigen.
PG  - E7348-E7357
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1707304114 [doi]
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lineage C 
      betacoronavirus that since its emergence in 2012 has caused outbreaks in human 
      populations with case-fatality rates of ∼36%. As in other coronaviruses, the 
      spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV mediates receptor recognition and membrane 
      fusion and is the primary target of the humoral immune response during infection. 
      Here we use structure-based design to develop a generalizable strategy for 
      retaining coronavirus S proteins in the antigenically optimal prefusion 
      conformation and demonstrate that our engineered immunogen is able to elicit high 
      neutralizing antibody titers against MERS-CoV. We also determined high-resolution 
      structures of the trimeric MERS-CoV S ectodomain in complex with G4, a 
      stem-directed neutralizing antibody. The structures reveal that G4 recognizes a 
      glycosylated loop that is variable among coronaviruses and they define four 
      conformational states of the trimer wherein each receptor-binding domain is 
      either tightly packed at the membrane-distal apex or rotated into a 
      receptor-accessible conformation. Our studies suggest a potential mechanism for 
      fusion initiation through sequential receptor-binding events and provide a 
      foundation for the structure-based design of coronavirus vaccines.

AB  - We identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in China a new bat-HKU2-like 
      porcine coronavirus (porcine enteric alphacoronavirus). The GDS04 strain of this 
      coronavirus shares high aa identities (>90%) with the reported bat-HKU2 strains 
      in Coronaviridae-wide conserved domains, suggesting that the GDS04 strain belongs 
      to the same species as HKU2.

PG  - 2180-2186
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.000520 [doi]
AB  - Ferret coronaviruses (FRCoVs) exist as an enteric and a systemic pathotype, of 
      which the latter is highly lethal to ferrets. To our knowledge, this study 
      provides the first full genome sequence of a FRCoV, tentatively called 
      FRCoV-NL-2010, which was detected in 2010 in ferrets in The Netherlands. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that FRCoV-NL-2010 is most closely related to mink 
      CoV, forming a separate clade of mustelid alphacoronavirus that split off early 
      from other alphacoronaviruses. Based on sequence homology of the complete genome, 
      we propose that these mustelid coronaviruses may be assigned to a new species. 
      Comparison of FRCoV-NL-2010 with the partially sequenced ferret systemic 
      coronavirus MSU-1 and ferret enteric coronavirus MSU-2 revealed that 
      recombination in the spike, 3c and envelope genes occurred between different 
      FRCoVs.

TI  - Palmitoylation of the Alphacoronavirus TGEV spike protein S is essential for 
      incorporation into virus-like particles but dispensable for S-M interaction.

AB  - The spike protein S of coronaviruses contains a highly conserved cytoplasmic 
      cysteine-rich motif adjacent to the transmembrane region. This motif is 
      palmitoylated in the Betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV. Here, we demonstrate by 
      metabolic labeling with [(3)H]-palmitic acid that the S protein of transmissible 
      gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus, is palmitoylated as 
      well. This is relevant for TGEV replication as virus growth was compromised by 
      the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate. Mutation of individual 
      cysteine clusters in the cysteine-rich motif of S revealed that all cysteines 
      must be replaced to abolish acylation and incorporation of S into virus-like 
      particles (VLP). Conversely, the interaction of S with the M protein, essential 
      for VLP incorporation of S, was not impaired by lack of palmitoylation. Thus, 
      palmitoylation of the S protein of Alphacoronaviruses is dispensable for S-M 
      interaction, but required for the generation of progeny virions.

AB  - The spike protein S of transmissible gastroenteritis virus, an Alphacoronavirus, 
      contains a tyrosine-based sorting signal that is responsible for ERGIC retention 
      and may be important for a correct viral assembly process. To find out whether 
      the S protein interacts with cellular proteins via this sorting signal, a 
      pulldown assay with GST fusion proteins was performed. Filamin A has been 
      identified as a putative interaction candidate. Immunofluorescence assays 
      confirmed a co-localization between the TGEV S protein and filamin A. Further 
      experiments have to be performed to prove a significant impact of filamin A on 
      TGEV infection. Different approaches of several researchers for the 
      identification of cellular interaction candidates relevant for coronavirus 
      replication are summarized. These results may help in the future to identify the 
      role of cellular proteins during coronavirus assembly at the ER-Golgi 
      intermediate compartment.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging infectious disease, caused 
      by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is considered to 
      be a zoonosis. However, the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV remain obscure, with 
      bats and camels as the most suspected sources. In this article, we review the 
      evidence supporting a bat/camel origin of human MERS-CoV infection and current 
      knowledge on the modes of camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

AB  - RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, a buffer against 
      environmental change. Nevertheless, the means by which random mutation improves 
      viral fitness is not well characterized. Here we report the X-ray crystal 
      structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the human coronavirus, 
      HCoV-229E, in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, aminopeptidase N 
      (APN). Three extended loops are solely responsible for receptor binding and the 
      evolution of HCoV-229E and its close relatives is accompanied by changing 
      loop-receptor interactions. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the natural 
      HCoV-229E receptor-binding loop variation observed defines six RBD classes whose 
      viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the 
      past 50 years. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for APN and their 
      ability to bind an HCoV-229E neutralizing antibody. Together, our results provide 
      a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution based on the use of 
      extended loops for receptor binding.

TI  - Global Epidemiology of Bat Coronaviruses.
LID - 10.3390/v11020174 [doi]
LID - 174
AB  - Bats are a unique group of mammals of the order Chiroptera. They are highly 
      diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of 
      species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be 
      potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals 
      capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they 
      harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at 
      reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses 
      (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In 
      the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete 
      genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. 
      Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. 
      As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, 
      Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be 
      more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For 
      betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and 
      Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the 
      reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are 
      closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat 
      species themselves, bat⁻animal and bat⁻human interactions, such as the presence 
      of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are 
      important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating 
      global outbreaks.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) likely originated in bats 
      and passed to humans through dromedary camels; however, the genetic mechanisms 
      underlying cross-species adaptation remain poorly understood. Variation in the 
      host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), can block the interaction with the 
      MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection. To better 
      understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal 
      species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption. Passaging virus on cells 
      expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike 
      which increased replication. Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral 
      adaptation to the same DPP4 variant. Structural analysis and functional assays 
      showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering 
      the surface charge of spike. These findings demonstrate that MERS-CoV spike can 
      utilize multiple paths to rapidly adapt to novel species variation in DPP4.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a betacoronavirus 
      which can cause acute respiratory distress in humans and is associated with a 
      relatively high mortality rate. Since it was first identified in a patient who 
      died in a Jeddah hospital in 2012, the World Health Organization has been 
      notified of 1735 laboratory-confirmed cases from 27 countries, including 628 
      deaths. Most cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoVancestors may be found 
      in OldWorld bats of the Vespertilionidae family. After a proposed bat to camel 
      switching event, transmission of MERS-CoV to humans is likely to have been the 
      result of multiple zoonotic transfers from dromedary camels. Human-to-human 
      transmission appears to require close contact with infected persons, with 
      outbreaks mainly occurring in hospital environments. Outbreaks have been 
      associated with inadequate infection prevention and control implementation, 
      resulting in recommendations on basic and more advanced infection prevention and 
      control measures by the World Health Organization, and issuing of government 
      guidelines based on these recommendations in affected countries including Saudi 
      Arabia. Evolutionary changes in the virus, particularly in the viral spike 
      protein which mediates virus-host cell contact may potentially increase 
      transmission of this virus. Efforts are on-going to identify specific 
      evidence-based therapies or vaccines. The broad-spectrum antiviral nitazoxanide 
      has been shown to have in vitro activity against MERS-CoV. Synthetic peptides and 
      candidate vaccines based on regions of the spike protein have shown promise in 
      rodent and non-human primate models. GLS-5300, a prophylactic DNA-plasmid vaccine 
      encoding S protein, is the first MERS-CoV vaccine to be tested in humans, while 
      monoclonal antibody, m336 has given promising results in animal models and has 
      potential for use in outbreak situations.

AB  - During the past two decades, three zoonotic coronaviruses have been identified as 
      the cause of large-scale disease outbreaks⁻Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Swine Acute Diarrhea 
      Syndrome (SADS). SARS and MERS emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and caused 
      a worldwide pandemic that claimed thousands of human lives, while SADS struck the 
      swine industry in 2017. They have common characteristics, such as they are all 
      highly pathogenic to humans or livestock, their agents originated from bats, and 
      two of them originated in China. Thus, it is highly likely that future SARS- or 
      MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an 
      increased probability that this will occur in China. Therefore, the investigation 
      of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent issue for the detection of early warning 
      signs, which in turn minimizes the impact of such future outbreaks in China. The 
      purpose of the review is to summarize the current knowledge on viral diversity, 
      reservoir hosts, and the geographical distributions of bat coronaviruses in 
      China, and eventually we aim to predict virus hotspots and their cross-species 
      transmission potential.

      Analysis of the complete genome sequence of 2 strains, FRCoV4370 and FRCoV063, 
      revealed that FRECV shared 49.9%-68.9% nucleotide sequence identity with known 
      coronaviruses. These results suggest that FRECV might be classified as a new 
      species in the genus Alphacoronavirus.

AB  - Eight hundred and thirteen European rodents and shrews encompassing seven 
      different species were screened for alphacoronaviruses using PCR detection. Novel 
      alphacoronaviruses were detected in the species Rattus norvegicus, Microtus 
      agrestis, Sorex araneus and Myodes glareolus. These, together with the recently 
      described Lucheng virus found in China, form a distinct rodent/shrew-specific 
      clade within the coronavirus phylogeny. Across a highly conserved region of the 
      viral polymerase gene, the new members of this clade were up to 22% dissimilar at 
      the nucleotide level to the previously described Lucheng virus. As such they 
      might represent distinct species of alphacoronaviruses. These data greatly extend 
      our knowledge of wildlife reservoirs of alphacoronaviruses.

AB  - Type-I IFNs (IFN-I) provide a key mediator of innate antiviral response during 
      virus proliferation. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes 
      diarrhea in swine of all ages, is a worldwide-distributed alphacoronavirus with 
      economic importance. Here, we screened PEDV RNA modification enzymes involved in 
      regulating antiviral response. Whereas the PEDV nsp13 barely regulates type I 
      IFN, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a) and MHCII, nsp16 and nsp14 (to a lesser 
      extent) down-regulate these antiviral effectors. Importantly, we found nsp16 KDKE 
      tetrad appears to play a key role in interferon inhibition by mutating the D129 
      catalytic residue. Mechanistically, nsp16 down-regulates the activities of RIG-I 
      and MDA5 mediated IFN-β and ISRE. In turn, the mRNA levels of IFIT family members 
      (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) was inhibited in cells overexpressing nsp16. In addition, 
      nsp10 enhanced the inhibitory effect of nsp16 on IFN-β. Altogether these results 
      indicate PEDV nsp16 negatively regulates innate immunity to promote viral 
      proliferation. Findings from this study provides novel perspective to advance the 
      understanding in the pathogenesis of PEDV.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease 
      caused by a novel single-stranded, positive-sense RNA betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
      Dromedary camels, hosts for MERS-CoV, are implicated in direct or indirect 
      transmission to human beings, although the exact mode of transmission is unknown. 
      The virus was first isolated from a patient who died from a severe respiratory 
      illness in June, 2012, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of May 31, 2015, 1180 
      laboratory-confirmed cases (483 deaths; 40% mortality) have been reported to WHO. 
      Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with 
      little human-to-human transmission reported in the community. Although most cases 
      of MERS have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cases have 
      been reported in Europe, the USA, and Asia in people who travelled from the 
      Middle East or their contacts. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic 
      or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure 
      resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. No 
      specific drug treatment exists for MERS and infection prevention and control 
      measures are crucial to prevent spread in health-care facilities. MERS-CoV 
      continues to be an endemic, low-level public health threat. However, the virus 
      could mutate to have increased interhuman transmissibility, increasing its 
      pandemic potential.

AB  - A new enteric virus of adult horses, equine coronavirus (ECoV), has recently been 
      recognized. It is associated with fever, lethargy, anorexia, and less frequently, 
      colic and diarrhea. This enteric virus is transmitted via the feco-oral route and 
      horses become infected by ingesting fecally contaminated feed and water. Various 
      outbreaks have been reported since 2010 from Japan, Europe and the USA. While the 
      clinical signs are fairly non-specific, lymphopenia and neutropenia are often 
      seen. Specific diagnosis is made by the detection of ECoV in feces by either 
      quantitative real-time PCR, electron microscopy or antigen-capture ELISA. 
      Supportive treatment is usually required, as most infections are self-limiting. 
      However, rare complications, such as endotoxemia, septicemia and 
      hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy, have been reported, and have been 
      related to the loss of barrier function at the intestinal mucosa. This review 
      article will focus on the latest information pertaining to the virus, 
      epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, pathology, treatment and prevention of 
      ECoV infection in adult horses.

AB  - Human beta1-coronavirus (β1CoV) OC43 emerged relatively recently through a single 
      zoonotic introduction. Like related animal β1CoVs, OC43 uses 9-O-acetylated 
      sialic acid as receptor determinant. β1CoV receptor binding is typically 
      controlled by attachment/fusion spike protein S and 
      receptor-binding/receptor-destroying hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE. We show 
      that following OC43's introduction into humans, HE-mediated receptor binding was 
      selected against and ultimately lost through progressive accumulation of 
      mutations in the HE lectin domain. Consequently, virion-associated 
      receptor-destroying activity toward multivalent glycoconjugates was reduced and 
      altered such that some clustered receptor populations are no longer cleaved. Loss 
      of HE lectin function was also observed for another respiratory human 
      coronavirus, HKU1. This thus appears to be an adaptation to the sialoglycome of 
      the human respiratory tract and for replication in human airways. The findings 
      suggest that the dynamics of virion-glycan interactions contribute to host 
      tropism. Our observations are relevant also to other human respiratory viruses of 
      zoonotic origin, particularly influenza A virus.

PG  - 1889-1891
LID - 10.1292/jvms.17-0414 [doi]
AB  - A vaccine for equine coronavirus (ECoV) is so far unavailable. Bovine coronavirus 
      (BCoV) is antigenically related to ECoV; it is therefore possible that BCoV 
      vaccine will induce antibodies against ECoV in horses. This study investigated 
      antibody response to ECoV in horses inoculated with BCoV vaccine. Virus 
      neutralization tests showed that antibody titers against ECoV increased in all 
      six horses tested at 14 days post inoculation, although the antibody titers were 
      lower against ECoV than against BCoV. This study showed that BCoV vaccine 
      provides horses with antibodies against ECoV to some extent. It is unclear 
      whether antibodies provided by BCoV vaccine are effective against ECoV, and 
      therefore ECoV challenge studies are needed to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine 
      in the future.

TI  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: another zoonotic betacoronavirus 
      causing SARS-like disease.
PG  - 465-522
LID - 10.1128/CMR.00102-14 [doi]
AB  - The source of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was traced to 
      wildlife market civets and ultimately to bats. Subsequent hunting for novel 
      coronaviruses (CoVs) led to the discovery of two additional human and over 40 
      animal CoVs, including the prototype lineage C betacoronaviruses, Tylonycteris 
      bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5; these are phylogenetically closely 
      related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, which has affected 
      more than 1,000 patients with over 35% fatality since its emergence in 2012. All 
      primary cases of MERS are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East. Some of 
      these patients had contacted camels which shed virus and/or had positive 
      serology. Most secondary cases are related to health care-associated clusters. 
      The disease is especially severe in elderly men with comorbidities. Clinical 
      severity may be related to MERS-CoV's ability to infect a broad range of cells 
      with DPP4 expression, evade the host innate immune response, and induce cytokine 
      dysregulation. Reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory and/or extrapulmonary 
      specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis. Supportive treatment with extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation and dialysis is often required in patients with organ 
      failure. Antivirals with potent in vitro activities include neutralizing 
      monoclonal antibodies, antiviral peptides, interferons, mycophenolic acid, and 
      lopinavir. They should be evaluated in suitable animal models before clinical 
      trials. Developing an effective camel MERS-CoV vaccine and implementing 
      appropriate infection control measures may control the continuing epidemic.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the causative agent of PED, is an 
      enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family 
      Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. PEDV non-structural accessory protein ORF3 is 
      an ion channel related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Our previous study 
      showed that PEDV ORF3 has expression characteristic of aggregation in cytoplasm, 
      but its biological function remains elusive. Thus in this study, we initiated the 
      construction of various vectors to express ORF3, and found ORF3 localized in the 
      cytoplasm in the aggregation manner. Subsequently, confocal microscopy analysis 
      showed that the aggregated ORF3 localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to 
      trigger ER stress response via up-regulation of GRP78 protein expression and 
      activation of PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway. In addition, our results showed that 
      PEDV ORF3 could induce the autophagy through inducing conversion of LC3-I to 
      LC3-II, but couldn't influence the apoptosis. In contrast, conversion of 
      LC3-I/LC3-II could be significantly inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, 
      indicating that ORF3-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress response. This 
      work not only provides some new findings for the biological function of the PEDV 
      ORF3 protein, but also help us for the further understanding the molecular 
      interaction between PEDV ORF3 protein and cells.

AB  - We report the complete genome sequences of a buffalo coronavirus (BufCoV HKU26) 
      detected from the faecal samples of two domestic water buffaloes (Bubalus 
      bubalis) in Bangladesh. They possessed 98-99% nucleotide identities to bovine 
      coronavirus (BCoV) genomes, supporting BufCoV HKU26 as a member of 
      Betacoronavirus 1. Nevertheless, BufCoV HKU26 possessed distinct accessory 
      proteins between spike and envelope compared to BCoV. Sugar-binding residues in 
      the N-terminal domain of S protein in BCoV are conserved in BufCoV HKU26.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged in 
      2003, causing the SARS epidemic which resulted in a 10% fatality rate. The 
      advancements in metagenomic techniques have allowed the identification of 
      SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) sequences that share high homology to the human 
      SARS-CoV epidemic strains from wildlife bats, presenting concrete evidence that 
      bats are the origin and natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. The application of reverse 
      genetics further enabled that characterization of these bat CoVs and the 
      prediction of their potential to cause disease in humans. The knowledge gained 
      from such studies is valuable in the surveillance and preparation of a possible 
      future outbreak caused by a spill-over of these bat SL-CoVs.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are an important cause of illness in humans and animals. 
      Most human coronaviruses commonly cause relatively mild respiratory illnesses; 
      however two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can cause severe 
      illness and death. Investigations over the past 35 years have illuminated many 
      aspects of coronavirus replication. The focus of this review is the functional 
      analysis of conserved RNA secondary structures in the 5' and 3' of the 
      betacoronavirus genomes. The 5' 350 nucleotides folds into a set of RNA secondary 
      structures which are well conserved, and reverse genetic studies indicate that 
      these structures play an important role in the discontinuous synthesis of 
      subgenomic RNAs in the betacoronaviruses. These cis-acting elements extend 3' of 
      the 5'UTR into ORF1a. The 3'UTR is similarly conserved and contains all of the 
      cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication. Two competing conformations 
      near the 5' end of the 3'UTR have been shown to make up a potential molecular 
      switch. There is some evidence that an association between the 3' and 5'UTRs is 
      necessary for subgenomic RNA synthesis, but the basis for this association is not 
      yet clear. A number of host RNA proteins have been shown to bind to the 5' and 3' 
      cis-acting regions, but the significance of these in viral replication is not 
      clear. Two viral proteins have been identified as binding to the 5' cis-acting 
      region, nsp1 and N protein. A genetic interaction between nsp8 and nsp9 and the 
      region of the 3'UTR that contains the putative molecular switch suggests that 
      these two proteins bind to this region.

AB  - Over the last 2 decades, yeast two-hybrid became an invaluable technique to 
      decipher protein-protein interaction networks. In the field of virology, it has 
      proven instrumental to identify virus-host interactions that are involved in 
      viral embezzlement of cellular functions and inhibition of immune mechanisms. 
      Here, we present a yeast two-hybrid protocol that has been used in our laboratory 
      since 2006 to search for cellular partners of more than 300 viral proteins. Our 
      aim was to develop a robust and straightforward pipeline, which minimizes 
      false-positive interactions with a decent coverage of target cDNA libraries, and 
      only requires a minimum of equipment. We also discuss reasons that motivated our 
      technical choices and compromises that had to be made. This protocol has been 
      used to screen most non-structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a 
      member of betacoronavirus genus, against a mouse brain cDNA library. Typical 
      results were obtained and are presented in this report.

AB  - Acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in swine at agricultural fairs in 
      Michigan, USA, in 2015 raised concern for potential human exposure to influenza A 
      virus. Testing ruled out influenza A virus and identified porcine 
      hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus as the cause of influenza-like illness 
      in the affected swine.

AB  - The 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large 
      disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable 
      focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies 
      and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. 
      Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates 
      for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and 
      induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well 
      as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad 
      vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for 
      stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened 
      outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines 
      against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on 
      these approaches here, particularly for Lassa fever, Nipah and MERS.

AB  - Bats have been recognized as the natural reservoirs of a large variety of 
      viruses. Special attention has been paid to bat coronaviruses as the two emerging 
      coronaviruses which have caused unexpected human disease outbreaks in the 21st 
      century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are suggested to be originated from 
      bats. Various species of horseshoe bats in China have been found to harbor 
      genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses. Some strains are highly similar to 
      SARS-CoV even in the spike protein and are able to use the same receptor as 
      SARS-CoV for cell entry. On the other hand, diverse coronaviruses 
      phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV have been discovered worldwide in a wide 
      range of bat species, some of which can be classified to the same coronavirus 
      species as MERS-CoV. Coronaviruses genetically related to human coronavirus 229E 
      and NL63 have been detected in bats as well. Moreover, intermediate hosts are 
      believed to play an important role in the transmission and emergence of these 
      coronaviruses from bats to humans. Understanding the bat origin of human 
      coronaviruses is helpful for the prediction and prevention of another pandemic 
      emergence in the future.

AB  - Bats carry a great diversity of zoonotic viruses with a high-impact on human 
      health and livestock. Since the emergence of new coronaviruses and 
      paramyxoviruses in humans (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV) and Nipah virus), numerous studies clearly established that bats can 
      maintain some of these viruses. Improving our understanding on the role of bats 
      in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent 
      cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, 
      we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus 
      in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt 
      bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of 
      Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of 
      Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains 
      and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus. Our 
      results highlighted the importance of monitoring virus circulation in wildlife, 
      especially bats, in the context of intense human-wildlife interfaces in order to 
      strengthen prevention measures among local populations and to implement sentinel 
      surveillance in sites with high zoonotic diseases transmission potential.

AB  - Coronavirus genome replication is mediated by a multi-subunit protein complex 
      that is comprised of more than a dozen virally encoded and several cellular 
      proteins. Interactions of the viral replicase complex with cis-acting RNA 
      elements located in the 5' and 3'-terminal genome regions ensure the specific 
      replication of viral RNA. Over the past years, boundaries and structures of 
      cis-acting RNA elements required for coronavirus genome replication have been 
      extensively characterized in betacoronaviruses and, to a lesser extent, other 
      coronavirus genera. Here, we review our current understanding of coronavirus 
      cis-acting elements located in the terminal genome regions and use a combination 
      of bioinformatic and RNA structure probing studies to identify and characterize 
      putative cis-acting RNA elements in alphacoronaviruses. The study suggests 
      significant RNA structure conservation among members of the genus 
      Alphacoronavirus but also across genus boundaries. Overall, the conservation 
      pattern identified for 5' and 3'-terminal RNA structural elements in the genomes 
      of alpha- and betacoronaviruses is in agreement with the widely used replicase 
      polyprotein-based classification of the Coronavirinae, suggesting co-evolution of 
      the coronavirus replication machinery with cognate cis-acting RNA elements.

TI  - Species-specific clinical characteristics of human coronavirus infection among 
      otherwise healthy adolescents and adults.
PG  - 299-303
LID - 10.1111/irv.12538 [doi]
AB  - Human coronavirus (HCoV) is a known cause of influenza-like illness (ILI). In a 
      multisite, observational, longitudinal study of ILI among otherwise healthy 
      adolescents and adults, 12% of subjects were PCR-positive for HCoV. The 
      distribution of species was as follows: HCoV-OC43 (34%), HCoV-229E (28%), 
      HCoV-NL63 (22%), and HCoV-HKU1 (16%). We did not observe species-specific 
      differences in the clinical characteristics of HCoV infection, with the exception 
      of HCoV-HKU1, for which the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms trended higher 
      on the fourth day of illness.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronaviruses 
      (BatCoVs). Previously, we demonstrated that both MERS-CoV and BatCoV HKU4 use 
      CD26 as a receptor, but how the BatCoVs evolved to bind CD26 is an intriguing 
      question. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the S1 subunit C-terminal 
      domain of HKU5 (HKU5-CTD), another BatCoV that is phylogenetically related to 
      MERS-CoV but cannot bind to CD26. We observed that the conserved core subdomain 
      and those of other betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) have a similar topology of the 
      external subdomain, indicating the same ancestor of lineage C betaCoVs. However, 
      two deletions in two respective loops located in HKU5-CTD result in 
      conformational variations in CD26-binding interface and are responsible for the 
      non-binding of HKU5-CTD to CD26. Combined with sequence variation in the HKU5-CTD 
      receptor binding interface, we propose the necessity for surveilling the mutation 
      in BatCoV HKU5 spike protein in case of bat-to-human interspecies transmission.

AB  - In late 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection 
      recurred in South Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that isolates 
      from the outbreaks were most closely related to emergent US strains of PEDV. 
      These US strain-like PEDV variants are prevalent in South Korea and responsible 
      for recent outbreaks in the country.

AB  - Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are zoonotic pathogens that crossed 
      the species barriers to infect humans. The mechanism of viral interspecies 
      transmission is an important scientific question to be addressed. These 
      coronaviruses contain a surface-located spike (S) protein that initiates 
      infection by mediating receptor-recognition and membrane fusion and is therefore 
      a key factor in host specificity. In addition, the S protein needs to be cleaved 
      by host proteases before executing fusion, making these proteases a second 
      determinant of coronavirus interspecies infection. Here, we summarize the 
      progress made in the past decade in understanding the cross-species transmission 
      of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by focusing on the features of the S protein, its 
      receptor-binding characteristics, and the cleavage process involved in priming.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a zoonotic viral disease that can be 
      transmitted from dromedaries to human beings. More than 1500 cases of MERS have 
      been reported in human beings to date. Although MERS has been associated with 30% 
      case fatality in human beings, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in 
      dromedaries is usually asymptomatic. In rare cases, dromedaries may develop mild 
      respiratory signs. No MERS-CoV or antibodies against the virus have been detected 
      in camelids other than dromedaries. MERS-CoV is mainly acquired in dromedaries 
      when they are less than 1 year of age, and the proportion of seropositivity 
      increases with age to a seroprevalence of 100% in adult dromedaries. Laboratory 
      diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries can be achieved through virus 
      isolation using Vero cells, RNA detection by real-time quantitative reverse 
      transcriptase-PCR and antigen detection using respiratory specimens or serum. 
      Rapid nucleocapsid antigen detection using a lateral flow platform allows 
      efficient screening of dromedaries carrying MERS-CoV. In addition to MERS-CoV, 
      which is a lineage C virus in the Betacoronavirus (betaCoV) genus, a lineage B 
      betaCoV and a virus in the Alphacoronavirus (alphaCoV) genus have been detected 
      in dromedaries. Dromedary CoV UAE-HKU23 is closely related to human CoV OC43, 
      whereas the alphaCoV has not been detected in human beings to date.

AB  - To understand how Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
      transmitted from bats to humans, we compared the virus surface spikes of MERS-CoV 
      and a related bat coronavirus, HKU4. Although HKU4 spike cannot mediate viral 
      entry into human cells, two mutations enabled it to do so by allowing it to be 
      activated by human proteases. These mutations are present in MERS-CoV spike, 
      explaining why MERS-CoV infects human cells. These mutations therefore played 
      critical roles in the bat-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV, either directly or 
      through intermediate hosts.

TI  - Contribution of porcine aminopeptidase N to porcine deltacoronavirus infection.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1038/s41426-018-0068-3 [doi]
LID - 65
AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of genus Deltacoronavirus, is an 
      emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV). Although outstanding efforts 
      have led to the identification of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus receptors, 
      the receptor for Deltacoronavirus is unclear. Here, we compared the amino acid 
      sequences of several representative CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PDCoV 
      spike (S) protein was close to the cluster containing transmissible 
      gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as a 
      functional receptor. Ectopic expression of pAPN in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells 
      rendered them susceptible to PDCoV. These results indicate that pAPN may be a 
      functional receptor for PDCoV infection. However, treatment with APN-specific 
      antibody and inhibitors did not completely block PDCoV infection in IPI-2I 
      porcine intestinal epithelial cells. pAPN knockout in IPI-2I cells completely 
      blocked TGEV infection but only slightly decreased PDCoV infection. Homologous 
      modeling of pAPN with the S1 C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of PDCoV or TGEV showed 
      that TGEV S1-CTD adopted β-turns (β1-β2 and β3-β4), forming the tip of a 
      β-barrel, to recognize pAPN. However, only the top residues in the β1-β2 turn of 
      PDCoV S1-CTD had the possibility to support an interaction with pAPN, and the 
      β3-β4 turn failed to contact pAPN. We also discuss the evolution and variation of 
      PDCoV S1-CTD based on structure information, providing clues to explain the usage 
      of pAPN by PDCoV. Taken together, the results presented herein reveal that pAPN 
      is likely not a critical functional receptor for PDCoV, although it is involved 
      in PDCoV infection.

LID - 10.1107/S2053230X14023085 [doi]
AB  - Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), which mainly causes acute self-limited 
      respiratory-tract infections, belongs to group A of the Betacoronavirus genus. 
      Coronavirus genomes encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16), which assemble 
      into a large replication-transcription complex mediating virus propagation. 
      Nonstructural protein 9, which binds to the single-stranded DNA/RNA, has been 
      shown to be indispensible for viral replication. Interestingly, a functional 
      mutant (N60K) of nsp9 was identified to compensate for a 6 nt insertion mutation 
      of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), which is critical for viral RNA synthesis. 
      It has been proposed that the N60K mutation may cause certain conformational 
      changes of nsp9 to rescue the defective insertion mutant. To further investigate 
      the underlying structural mechanism, the N60K mutant of nsp9 from HCoV-HKU1 was 
      successfully crystallized in this study. The crystals diffracted to 2.6 Å 
      resolution and belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 
      31.9, b = 85.0, c = 95.0 Å. Two molecules were identified per asymmetric unit.

AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a typical neurotropic 
      virus that can cause obvious nerve damage. Integrin α5β1 is a transmembrane 
      macromolecular that closely related to neurological function. We recently 
      demonstrated that integrin α5β1 plays a critical role in PHEV invasion in vitro. 
      To determine the function and mechanism of integrin α5β1 in virus proliferation 
      in vivo, we established a mouse model of PHEV infection. Integrin α5β1-FAK 
      signaling pathway was activated in PHEV-infected mice by qPCR, Western blotting, 
      and GST pull-down assays. Viral proliferation and integrin α5β1-FAK signaling 
      pathway were significantly inhibited after intravenous injection of ATN-161, an 
      integrin α5β1 inhibitor. Through a histological analysis, we found that 
      ATN-161-treated mice only showed pathological changes in neuronal cytoplasmic 
      swelling at 5 day post-infection. In summary, our results provide the first 
      evidence that ATN-161 inhibits the proliferation of PHEV in mice and explores its 
      underlying mechanisms of action.

AB  - The first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), associated with 
      infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV), occurred in 2012 in Jordan but were 
      reported retrospectively. The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, 
      in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been 
      found in a bat and in many dromedary camels (DC). MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC 
      across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper 
      respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively 
      rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown 
      but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal 
      point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known 
      as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing 
      difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20% to 40% of those infected. However, 
      MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those 
      with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and 
      MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS), another sometimes- fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has 
      since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute 
      kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under 
      laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying 
      disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to 
      lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with 
      approximately 20% of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers 
      (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close 
      contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past 
      infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, 
      validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the 
      emergence of MERS. While the basic virology of MERS-CoV has advanced over the 
      past three years, understanding of the interplay between camel, environment, and 
      human remains limited.

TI  - The emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea in Croatia: molecular 
      characterization and serology.
PG  - 249

AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is an emergent/re-emergent viral pig 
      disease (caused by the virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, in specific 
      the Alphacoronavirus genus) of global importance. Clinical presentation is 
      characterized with acute diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in pigs of all ages, 
      with a possible high mortality in suckling piglets. The disease emerged in the 
      USA in 2013 causing heavy losses, and re-emerged in Europe in 2014, but with 
      milder consequences. RESULTS: In the spring 2016, PED-like symptoms were reported 
      to be seen on an agricultural holding in Eastern Croatia; laboratory workup 
      confirmed the Croatia's first PED outbreak ever. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus 
      (PEDV) strain responsible for the outbreak was of the S-INDEL genotype, much the 
      same as other European PEDV strains. In 2017, a post-outbreak serology was 
      carried out in three counties in Eastern Croatia, revealing seropositivity in 
      pigs bred on four large industrial holdings (9.09%). The seroprevalence across 
      PEDV-positive holdings was up to 82.8%. The latter holdings were unanimously 
      managed by an enterprise that had never reported PED before. CONCLUSIONS: PED has 
      emerged in Croatian pig population causing potentially considerable losses. The 
      circulating strain was of the S-INDEL genotype. Serological workup proved PEDV 
      spread to another four agricultural holdings, demonstrating the importance of not 
      only external, but also internal biosecurity measures.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerging infectious disease 
      caused by a novel coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new member in the 
      lineage C of β-coronavirus (β-CoV). The increased human cases and high mortality 
      rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective 
      vaccines. In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in 
      the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV 
      spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed. How to 
      improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and 
      routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for 
      evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed. Overall, 
      these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective 
      and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future.

AB  - A 29 nucleotide deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) is the most obvious 
      genetic change in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during 
      its emergence in humans. In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether 
      the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans. Here we engineered full, 
      partially deleted (-29 nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious 
      cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared 
      in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for 
      SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep 
      provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is 
      neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of 
      ORF8 (29 nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold. The effect was 
      independent of the type I interferon response. The 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV is 
      a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission 
      chain. The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has 
      rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence. These results have 
      important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by 
      SARS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are six human pathogenic coronaviruses (CoV), which mainly 
      cause infections of the respiratory system. In everyday clinical practice, it is 
      helpful to know the relevance and characteristics of these pathogens. OBJECTIVE: 
      To present the epidemiology, clinical picture and differences of human pathogenic 
      CoV and to provide information on the diagnostics and treatment of patients 
      suspected of having CoV infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Selective literature 
      search, presentation of results and discussion of fundamental works and expert 
      recommendations, including publications by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
      the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Robert Koch 
      Institute. RESULTS: The four endemic human CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 
      and HCoV-HKU1) mainly cause mild respiratory tract infections. In addition to 
      these four endemic HCoV, the two epidemic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV can cause severe 
      pneumonia. The SARS-CoV has not been detected in humans in the last 15 years and 
      MERS-CoV has been circulating mainly on the Arabian Peninsula since 2012; 
      however, neither a specific treatment nor approved vaccines exist for any of the 
      six human pathogenic CoVs. CONCLUSION: All six human CoVs can be diagnosed using 
      RT-PCR on respiratory specimens but this is rarely necessary for the four endemic 
      strains. In current clinical practice SARS-CoV has no importance as it has not 
      been detected in humans for 15 years; however, a possible MERS-CoV infection 
      should be taken into account in patients with typical symptoms and travel history 
      to endemic regions. In this case, rapid diagnostic and general hygiene practices 
      are important to prevent further transmission.

AB  - Widespread geographic movement and extensive comingling of exhibition swine 
      facilitates the spread and transmission of infectious pathogens. Nasal samples 
      were collected from 2862 pigs at 102 exhibitions and tested for five pathogens. 
      At least one pathogen was molecularly detected in pigs at 63 (61.8%) exhibitions. 
      Influenza A virus was most prevalent and was detected in 498 (17.4%) samples. 
      Influenza D virus was detected in two (0.07%) samples. More than one pathogen was 
      detected in 165 (5.8%) samples. Influenza A virus remains a top threat to animal 
      and human health, but other pathogens may be disseminated through the exhibition 
      swine population.

AB  - SHAPE technology was used to analyze RNA secondary structure of the 5' most 474 
      nts of the MHV-A59 genome encompassing the minimal 5' cis-acting region required 
      for defective interfering RNA replication. The structures generated were in 
      agreement with previous characterizations of SL1 through SL4 and two recently 
      predicted secondary structure elements, S5 and SL5A. SHAPE provided biochemical 
      support for four additional stem-loops not previously functionally investigated 
      in MHV. Secondary structure predictions for 5' regions of MHV-A59, BCoV and 
      SARS-CoV were similar despite high sequence divergence. The pattern of SHAPE 
      reactivity of in virio genomic RNA, ex virio genomic RNA, and in vitro 
      synthesized RNA was similar, suggesting that binding of N protein or other 
      proteins to virion RNA fails to protect the RNA from reaction with lipid 
      permeable SHAPE reagent. Reverse genetic experiments suggested that SL5C and SL6 
      within the nsp1 coding sequence are not required for viral replication.

AB  - A novel human coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the 
      causative agent of severe acute respiratory diseases in 2012. The virus was 
      termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is taken 
      notice of important coronavirus caused severe diseases to human after the 
      outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. There is a lot 
      of unknown characterization regarding MERS-CoV because of less than one year 
      after finding the first case. MERS-CoV was related to the 2C betacoronavirus 
      clade and is closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and 
      Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. Thus, bats are thought to be natural hosts of 
      this virus. Recently, there were reports supposed to be cases of human to human 
      infection. There are growing concerns about spread of infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rodents represent the most diverse mammals on the planet and are 
      important reservoirs of human pathogens. Coronaviruses infect various animals, 
      but to date, relatively few coronaviruses have been identified in rodents 
      worldwide. The evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in rodent have not been 
      fully investigated. RESULTS: In this study, we collected 177 intestinal samples 
      from thress species of rodents in Jianchuan County, Yunnan Province, China. 
      Alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus were detected in 23 rodent samples from 
      three species, namely Apodemus chevrieri (21/98), Eothenomys fidelis (1/62), and 
      Apodemus ilex (1/17). We further characterized the full-length genome of an 
      alphacoronavirus from the A. chevrieri rat and named it as AcCoV-JC34. The 
      AcCoV-JC34 genome was 27,649 nucleotides long and showed a structure similar to 
      the HKU2 bat coronavirus. Comparing the normal transcription regulatory sequence 
      (TRS), 3 variant TRS sequences upstream the spike (S), ORF3, and ORF8 genes were 
      found in the genome of AcCoV-JC34. In the conserved replicase domains, AcCoV-JC34 
      was most closely related to Rattus norvegicus coronavirus LNRV but diverged from 
      other alphacoronaviruses, indicating that AcCoV-JC34 and LNRV may represent a 
      novel alphacoronavirus species. However, the S and nucleocapsid proteins showed 
      low similarity to those of LRNV, with 66.5 and 77.4% identities, respectively. 
      Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the S genes of AcCoV-JC34, LRNV, and HKU2 
      formed a distinct lineage with all known coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Both 
      alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses were detected in Apodemus chevrieri in 
      the Yunnan Province of China, indicating that Apodemus chevrieri is an important 
      host for coronavirus. Several new features were identified in the genome of an 
      Apodemus chevrieri coronavirus. The phylogenetic distance to other coronaviruses 
      suggests a variable origin and evolutionary route of the S genes of AcCoV-JC34, 
      LRNV, and HKU2. These results indicate that the diversity of rodent coronaviruses 
      is much higher than previously expected. Further surveillance and functional 
      studies of these coronaviruses will help to better understand the importance of 
      rodent as host for coronaviruses.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, triggered the discovery of a high 
      diversity of coronaviruses in bats. Studies from Europe have shown that 
      coronaviruses circulate in bats in France but this reflects only a fraction of 
      the whole diversity. In the current study the diversity of coronaviruses 
      circulating in western Europe was extensively explored. Ten alphacoronaviruses in 
      eleven bat species belonging to the Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and 
      Rhinolophidae families and, a SARS-CoV-related Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophus 
      ferrumequinum were identified. The diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses 
      presently reported from western Europe is much higher than previously described 
      and includes a SARS-CoV sister group. This diversity demonstrates the dynamic 
      evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species. That said, the 
      identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat 
      species or genus, and these relationships were maintained no matter the 
      geographic location. The observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the 
      same species in Europe and Asia, emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution 
      in this group.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute infectious disease of the 
      respiratory system caused by the new betacoronavirus (MERS coronavirus, 
      MERS-CoV), which shows high mortality rates. The typical symptoms of MERS are 
      fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and it is often accompanied by pneumonia. 
      The MERS-CoV was introduced to Republic of Korea in May 2015 by a patient 
      returning from Saudi Arabia. The disease spread mostly through hospital 
      infections, and by the time the epidemic ended in August, the total number of 
      confirmed diagnoses was 186, among which 36 patients died. Reflecting the latest 
      evidence for antiviral drugs in the treatment of MERS-CoV infection and the 
      experiences of treating MERS patients in Republic of Korea, these guidelines 
      focus on antiviral drugs to achieve effective treatment of MERS-CoV infections.

AB  - Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 
      (PEDV) are similar coronaviruses, causing diseases characterized by vomiting, 
      diarrhea, and death from severe dehydration in piglets. Thus, they have caused 
      huge losses to the swine-breeding industry worldwide. Nowadays, they are easily 
      transmitted among the continents via vehicles, equipment, and cargo. Both viruses 
      establish an infection in porcine enterocytes in the small intestine, and their 
      spike (S) proteins play a key role in the virus-cell binding process under 
      unfavorable conditions when the intestine with a low pH is filled with a thick 
      layer of mucus and proteases. Sialic acid, proteases, and low pH are three main 
      inducers of coronavirus infection. However, the details of how sialic acid and 
      low pH affect virus binding to the host cell are not determined, and the 
      functions of the proteases are unknown. This review emphasizes the role of three 
      factors in the invasion of TGEV and PEDV into porcine enterocytes and offers more 
      insights into Alphacoronavirus infection in the intestinal environment.

AB  - In recent years severe infectious diseases have been constantly emerging, causing 
      panic in the world. Now we know that many of these terrible diseases are caused 
      by viruses originated from bats (Table 1), such as Ebola virus, Marburg, SARS 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra 
      virus (HeV). These viruses have co-evolved with bats due to bats' special social, 
      biological and immunological features. Although bats are not in close contact 
      with humans, spillover of viruses from bats to intermediate animal hosts, such as 
      horses, pigs, civets, or non-human primates, is thought to be the most likely 
      mode to cause human infection. Humans may also become infected with viruses 
      through aerosol by intruding into bat roosting caves or via direct contact with 
      bats, such as catching bats or been bitten by bats.

TI  - Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection Inhibits Interferon Signaling by 
      Targeted Degradation of STAT1.
PG  - 8281-92
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01091-16 [doi]
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a worldwide-distributed 
      alphacoronavirus, but the pathogenesis of PEDV infection is not fully 
      characterized. During virus infection, type I interferon (IFN) is a key mediator 
      of innate antiviral responses. Most coronaviruses develop some strategy for at 
      least partially circumventing the IFN response by limiting the production of IFN 
      and by delaying the activation of the IFN response. However, the molecular 
      mechanisms by which PEDV antagonizes the antiviral effects of interferon have not 
      been fully characterized. Especially, how PEDV impacts IFN signaling components 
      has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that PEDV was relatively 
      resistant to treatment with type I IFN. Western blot analysis showed that STAT1 
      expression was markedly reduced in PEDV-infected cells and that this reduction 
      was not due to inhibition of STAT1 transcription. STAT1 downregulation was 
      blocked by a proteasome inhibitor but not by an autophagy inhibitor, strongly 
      implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome targeting degradation system. Since PEDV 
      infection-induced STAT1 degradation was evident in cells pretreated with the 
      general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, we conclude that STAT1 degradation is 
      independent of the IFN signaling pathway. Furthermore, we report that 
      PEDV-induced STAT1 degradation inhibits IFN-α signal transduction pathways. 
      Pharmacological inhibition of STAT1 degradation rescued the ability of the host 
      to suppress virus replication. Collectively, these data show that PEDV is capable 
      of subverting the type I interferon response by inducing STAT1 degradation. 
      IMPORTANCE: In this study, we show that PEDV is resistant to the antiviral effect 
      of IFN. The molecular mechanism is the degradation of STAT1 by PEDV infection in 
      a proteasome-dependent manner. This PEDV infection-induced STAT1 degradation 
      contributes to PEDV replication. Our findings reveal a new mechanism evolved by 
      PEDV to circumvent the host antiviral response.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus 
      discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 
      Though not confirmed yet, multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest 
      a bat origin. The disease is heavily endemic in dromedary camel populations of 
      East Africa and the Middle East. It is unclear as to when the virus was 
      introduced to dromedary camels, but data from studies that investigated stored 
      dromedary camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dromedary camel 
      populations suggested that the virus was present in dromedary camels several 
      decades ago. Though bats and alpacas can serve as potential reservoirs for 
      MERS-CoV, dromedary camels seem to be the only animal host responsible for the 
      spill over human infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MERS-CoV is a newly emerged human coronavirus reported closely 
      related with HKU4 and HKU5 Bat coronaviruses. Bat and MERS corona-viruses are 
      structurally related. Therefore, it is of interest to estimate the degree of 
      conserved antigenic sites among them. It is of importance to elucidate the shared 
      antigenic-sites and extent of conservation between them to understand the 
      evolutionary dynamics of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment of the 
      spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins was employed 
      to identify the sequence conservation among MERS and Bat (HKU4, HKU5) 
      coronaviruses. We used various in silico tools to predict the conserved antigenic 
      sites. We found that MERS-CoV shared 30 % of its S protein antigenic sites with 
      HKU4 and 70 % with HKU5 bat-CoV. Whereas 100 % of its E, M and N protein's 
      antigenic sites are found to be conserved with those in HKU4 and HKU5. 
      CONCLUSION: This sharing suggests that in case of pathogenicity MERS-CoV is more 
      closely related to HKU5 bat-CoV than HKU4 bat-CoV. The conserved epitopes 
      indicates their evolutionary relationship and ancestry of pathogenicity.

AB  - Coronaviruses tend to efficiently evade innate immune sensing. 
      Alpha-coronaviruses interfere with the type I interferon (IFN) response in 
      various ways, ensuring the limited activation of IFN responses. Transmissible 
      gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus genera virus, is an important 
      pathogen that mainly infects piglet, but little is known about the activation of 
      the host immune response. We show that TGEV induces a delayed activation of the 
      IFN response in intestinal epithelial cells. Briefly, IFN-β expression induced by 
      TGEV infection is delayed with respect to that induced by poly(I:C) transfection. 
      In addition, some of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were up-regulated in the 
      early infection stage without obvious expression of IFN-β. Moreover, we show that 
      activation of IFN responses induced by poly(I:C) could inhibit viral replication 
      in the early infection stage, but failed in the late infection stage in IPEC-J2 
      cells. Finally, the activation of IFN responses induced by TGEV infection cannot 
      inhibit viral replication. Taken together, this study provides a preliminary 
      analysis of an interaction between TGEV and IFN-β responses of intestinal 
      epithelial cells.

TI  - Cryo-Electron Microscopy Structure of Porcine Deltacoronavirus Spike Protein in 
      the Prefusion State.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01556-17 [doi]
LID - e01556-17
AB  - Coronavirus spike proteins from different genera are divergent, although they all 
      mediate coronavirus entry into cells by binding to host receptors and fusing 
      viral and cell membranes. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy 
      structure of porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) spike protein at 3.3-Å resolution. 
      The trimeric protein contains three receptor-binding S1 subunits that tightly 
      pack into a crown-like structure and three membrane fusion S2 subunits that form 
      a stalk. Each S1 subunit contains two domains, an N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and 
      C-terminal domain (S1-CTD). PdCoV S1-NTD has the same structural fold as alpha- 
      and betacoronavirus S1-NTDs as well as host galectins, and it recognizes sugar as 
      its potential receptor. PdCoV S1-CTD has the same structural fold as 
      alphacoronavirus S1-CTDs, but its structure differs from that of betacoronavirus 
      S1-CTDs. PdCoV S1-CTD binds to an unidentified receptor on host cell surfaces. 
      PdCoV S2 is locked in the prefusion conformation by structural restraint of S1 
      from a different monomeric subunit. PdCoV spike possesses several structural 
      features that may facilitate immune evasion by the virus, such as its compact 
      structure, concealed receptor-binding sites, and shielded critical epitopes. 
      Overall, this study reveals that deltacoronavirus spikes are structurally and 
      evolutionally more closely related to alphacoronavirus spikes than to 
      betacoronavirus spikes; it also has implications for the receptor recognition, 
      membrane fusion, and immune evasion by deltacoronaviruses as well as 
      coronaviruses in general. IMPORTANCE In this study, we determined the 
      cryo-electron microscopy structure of porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) spike 
      protein at a 3.3-Å resolution. This is the first atomic structure of a spike 
      protein from the deltacoronavirus genus, which is divergent in amino acid 
      sequences from the well-studied alpha- and betacoronavirus spike proteins. Here, 
      we described the overall structure of the PdCoV spike and the detailed structure 
      of each of its structural elements. Moreover, we analyzed the functions of each 
      of the structural elements. Based on the structures and functions of these 
      structural elements, we discussed the evolution of PdCoV spike protein in 
      relation to the spike proteins from other coronavirus genera. This study combines 
      the structure, function, and evolution of PdCoV spike protein and provides many 
      insights into its receptor recognition, membrane fusion, and immune evasion.

TI  - Molecular identification of Betacoronavirus in bats from Sardinia (Italy): first 
      detection and phylogeny.

AB  - Bats may be natural reservoirs for a large variety of emerging viruses, including 
      mammalian coronaviruses (CoV). The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans, with evidence that these viruses may have their 
      ancestry in bats, highlights the importance of virus surveillance in bat 
      populations. Here, we report the identification and molecular characterization of 
      a bat β-Coronavirus, detected during a viral survey carried out on different bat 
      species in the island of Sardinia (Italy). Cutaneous, oral swabs, and faecal 
      samples were collected from 46 bats, belonging to 15 different species, and 
      tested for viral presence. Coronavirus RNA was detected in faecal samples from 
      three different species: the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), 
      the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), and the European free-tailed bat 
      (Tadarida teniotis). Phylogenetic analyses based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      (RdRp) sequences assigned the detected CoV to clade 2b within betacoronaviruses, 
      clustering with SARS-like bat CoVs previously reported. These findings point to 
      the need for continued surveillance of bat CoV circulating in Sardinian bats, and 
      extend the current knowledge on CoV ecology with novel sequences detected in bat 
      species not previously described as β-Coronavirus hosts.

AB  - Bats have been implicated as important reservoir hosts of alpha- and 
      betacoronaviruses. In this study, diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) were detected in 
      50 of 951 (positive rate 5.3%) intestinal specimens of eight bat species 
      collected in four provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China by 
      pan-coronavirus RT-PCR screening. Based on 400-nt RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
      (RdRP) sequence analysis, eight belonged to genus Alphacoronavirus and 42 to 
      Betacoronavirus. Among the 50 positive specimens, thirteen gave rise to CoV 
      full-length RdRP gene amplification for further sequence comparison, of which 
      three divergent sequences (two from a unreported province) were subjected to full 
      genome sequencing. Two complete genomes of betacoronaviruses (JTMC15 and JPDB144) 
      and one nearly-complete genome of alphacoronavirus (JTAC2) were sequenced and 
      their genomic organization predicted. The present study has identified additional 
      numbers of genetically diverse bat-borne coronaviruses with a wide distribution 
      in China. Two new species of bat CoV, identified through sequence comparison and 
      phylogenetic analysis, are proposed.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera Alphacoronavirus 
      in the family Coronaviridae, causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration and high 
      mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. For the last three decades, PEDV 
      infection has resulted in significant economic losses in the European and Asian 
      pig industries, but in 2013-2014 the disease was also reported in the US, Canada 
      and Mexico. The PED epidemic in the US, from April 2013 to the present, has led 
      to the loss of more than 10% of the US pig population. The disappearance and 
      re-emergence of epidemic PED indicates that the virus is able to escape from 
      current vaccination protocols, biosecurity and control systems. Endemic PED is a 
      significant problem, which is exacerbated by the emergence (or potential 
      importation) of multiple PEDV variants. Epidemic PEDV strains spread rapidly and 
      cause a high number of pig deaths. These strains are highly enteropathogenic and 
      acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines 
      although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites. PEDV infections cause 
      acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by viremia that leads to profound 
      diarrhea and vomiting, followed by extensive dehydration, which is the major 
      cause of death in nursing piglets. A comprehensive understanding of the 
      pathogenic characteristics of epidemic or endemic PEDV strains is needed to 
      prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective 
      vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, disease mechanisms 
      and pathogenesis as well as immunoprophylaxis against PEDV infection.

AB  - Since discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a 
      novel betacoronavirus first isolated and characterized in 2012, MERS-CoV 
      real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays 
      represent one of the most rapidly expanding commercial tests. However, in the 
      absence of extensive evaluations of these assays on positive clinical material of 
      different sources, evaluating their diagnostic effectiveness remains challenging. 
      We describe the diagnostic performance evaluation of 3 common commercial MERS-CoV 
      rRT-PCR assays on a large panel (n = 234) of upper respiratory tract specimens 
      collected during an outbreak episode in Saudi Arabia. Assays were compared to the 
      RealStar® MERS-CoV RT-PCR (Alton Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) assay as the gold 
      standard. Results showed i) the TIB MolBiol® LightMix UpE and Orf1a assays (TIB 
      MolBiol, Berlin, Germany) to be the most sensitive, followed by ii) the Anyplex™ 
      Seegene MERS-CoV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), and finally iii) the 
      PrimerDesign™ Genesig® HCoV_2012 assay (PrimerDesign, England, United Kingdom). 
      We also evaluate a modified protocol for the PrimerDesign™ Genesig® HCoV_2012 
      assay.

TI  - Coronavirus Infection and Diversity in Bats in the Australasian Region.
PG  - 72-82
LID - 10.1007/s10393-016-1116-x [doi]
AB  - Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to 
      detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats. This study sought to identify 
      the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. 
      We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an 
      alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having 
      less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related 
      described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite 
      targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support 
      the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat 
      coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong 
      and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel 
      betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to 
      Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the 
      Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat 
      coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our 
      findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host 
      specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host 
      shift.

AB  - Environmental modifications are leading to biodiversity changes, loss and habitat 
      disturbance. This in turn increases contacts between wildlife and hence the risk 
      of transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. We analyzed the environment 
      and land use using remote spatial data around the sampling locations of bats 
      positive for coronavirus (21 sites) and astrovirus (11 sites) collected in 43 
      sites. A clear association between viruses and hosts was observed. Viruses 
      associated to synanthropic bat genera, such as Myotis or Scotophilus were 
      associated to highly transformed habitats with human presence while viruses 
      associated to fruit bat genera were correlated with natural environments with 
      dense forest, grassland areas and regions of high elevation. In particular, group 
      C betacoronavirus were associated with mosaic habitats found in anthropized 
      environments.

AB  - Human coronavirus (CoV) HKU1 is a pathogen causing acute respiratory illnesses 
      and so far little is known about its biology. HKU1 virus uses its S1 subunit 
      C-terminal domain (CTD) and not the N-terminal domain like other lineage A β-CoVs 
      to bind to its yet unknown human receptor. Here we present the crystal structure 
      of HKU1 CTD at 1.9 Å resolution. The structure consists of three subdomains: 
      core, insertion and subdomain-1 (SD-1). While the structure of the core and SD-1 
      subdomains of HKU1 are highly similar to those of other β-CoVs, the insertion 
      subdomain adopts a novel fold, which is largely invisible in the cryo-EM 
      structure of the HKU1 S trimer. We identify five residues in the insertion 
      subdomain that are critical for binding of neutralizing antibodies and two 
      residues essential for receptor binding. Our study contributes to a better 
      understanding of entry, immunity and evolution of CoV S proteins.

      vaccines.
PG  - 166-76
LID - 10.7774/cevr.2015.4.2.166 [doi]
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus in the family 
      Coronaviridae, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality 
      rates in neonatal piglets. PEDV can also cause diarrhea, agalactia, and abnormal 
      reproductive cycles in pregnant sows. Although PEDV was first identified in 
      Europe, it has resulted in significant economic losses in many Asian 
      swine-raising countries, including Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam, and the 
      Philippines. However, from April 2013 to the present, major outbreaks of PEDV 
      have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Moreover, 
      intercontinental transmission of PEDV has increased mortality rates in 
      seronegative neonatal piglets, resulting in 10% loss of the US pig population. 
      The emergence and re-emergence of PEDV indicates that the virus is able to evade 
      current vaccine strategies. Continuous emergence of multiple mutant strains from 
      several regions has aggravated porcine epidemic diarrhea endemic conditions and 
      highlighted the need for new vaccines based on the current circulating PEDV. 
      Epidemic PEDV strains tend to be more pathogenic and cause increased death in 
      pigs, thereby causing substantial financial losses for swine producers. In this 
      review, we described the epidemiology of PEDV in several countries and present 
      molecular characterization of current strains. We also discuss PEDV vaccines and 
      related issues.

TI  - The close genetic relationship of lineage D Betacoronavirus from Nigerian and 
      Kenyan straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) is consistent with the existence 
      of a single epidemiological unit across sub-Saharan Africa.
PG  - 573-7
LID - 10.1007/s11262-016-1331-0 [doi]
AB  - Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum), which have been identified as natural 
      hosts for several zoonotic pathogens, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, and 
      ebolavirus, are associated with human settlements in Nigeria where they are 
      commonly consumed as a delicacy. However, information on the viruses harbored by 
      these bats is scarce. In this study, coronavirus sequences were detected using a 
      nested RT-PCR targeting 440 bp of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in six 
      of 79 fecal samples collected from an urban colony of E. helvum in Ibadan, 
      Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six sequences were monophyletic 
      and clustered in lineage D of Betacoronavirus. The extension of two fragments 
      allowed us to classify our sequences within the RdRp Group Unit defined for 
      Kenyan Betacoronavirus from the same host species. These findings are consistent 
      with the previous suggestion on the existence of a single epidemiological unit of 
      E. helvum across sub-Saharan Africa. This theory, which is supported by the 
      genetic structure of continental E. helvum, could facilitate viral mixing between 
      different colonies across the continent.

TI  - Pre-fusion structure of a human coronavirus spike protein.
PG  - 118-21
LID - 10.1038/nature17200 [doi]
AB  - HKU1 is a human betacoronavirus that causes mild yet prevalent respiratory 
      disease, and is related to the zoonotic SARS and MERS betacoronaviruses, which 
      have high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Cell tropism and host range is 
      determined in part by the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which binds cellular 
      receptors and mediates membrane fusion. As the largest known class I fusion 
      protein, its size and extensive glycosylation have hindered structural studies of 
      the full ectodomain, thus preventing a molecular understanding of its function 
      and limiting development of effective interventions. Here we present the 4.0 Å 
      resolution structure of the trimeric HKU1 S protein determined using 
      single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. In the pre-fusion conformation, the 
      receptor-binding subunits, S1, rest above the fusion-mediating subunits, S2, 
      preventing their conformational rearrangement. Surprisingly, the S1 C-terminal 
      domains are interdigitated and form extensive quaternary interactions that 
      occlude surfaces known in other coronaviruses to bind protein receptors. These 
      features, along with the location of the two protease sites known to be important 
      for coronavirus entry, provide a structural basis to support a model of membrane 
      fusion mediated by progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding 
      and proteolytic cleavage. These studies should also serve as a foundation for the 
      structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens.

AB  - Outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn piglets without detection of transmissible 
      gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine 
      deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), have been recorded in a pig farm in southern China 
      since February 2017. Isolation and propagation of the pathogen in cell culture 
      resulted in discovery of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (tentatively 
      named SeACoV) related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 identified in the same region a 
      decade ago. Specific fluorescence signal was detected in Vero cells infected with 
      SeACoV by using a positive sow serum collected in the same farm, but not by using 
      TGEV-, PEDV- or PDCoV-specific antibody. Electron microscopy observation 
      demonstrated that the virus particle with surface projections was 100-120nm in 
      diameter. Complete genomic sequencing and analyses of SeACoV indicated that the 
      extreme amino-terminal domain of the SeACoV spike (S) glycoprotein structurally 
      similar to the domain 0 of the alphacoronavirus NL63, whereas the rest part of S 
      structurally resembles domains B to D of the betacoronavirus. The SeACoV-S domain 
      0 associated with enteric tropism had an extremely high variability, harboring 
      75-amino-acid (aa) substitutions and a 2-aa insertion, compared to that of HKU2, 
      which is likely responsible for the extended host range or cross-species 
      transmission. The isolated virus was infectious in pigs when inoculated orally 
      into 3-day-old newborn piglets, leading to clinical signs of diarrhea and fecal 
      virus shedding. These results confirmed that it is a novel swine enteric 
      coronavirus representing the fifth porcine coronavirus.

AB  - Coronavirus tropism is predominantly determined by the interaction between 
      coronavirus spikes and the host receptors. In this regard, coronaviruses have 
      evolved a complicated receptor-recognition system through their spike proteins. 
      Spikes from highly related coronaviruses can recognize distinct receptors, 
      whereas spikes of distant coronaviruses can employ the same cell-surface molecule 
      for entry. Moreover, coronavirus spikes can recognize a broad range of 
      cell-surface molecules in addition to the receptors and thereby can augment 
      coronavirus attachment or entry. The receptor of Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). In this study, we 
      identified membrane-associated 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as an 
      additional binding target of the MERS-CoV spike. Further analyses indicated that 
      GRP78 could not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV 
      infection but could facilitate MERS-CoV entry into permissive cells by augmenting 
      virus attachment. More importantly, by exploring potential interactions between 
      GRP78 and spikes of other coronaviruses, we discovered that the highly conserved 
      human GRP78 could interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9 
      (bCoV-HKU9) and facilitate its attachment to the host cell surface. Taken 
      together, our study has identified GRP78 as a host factor that can interact with 
      the spike proteins of two Betacoronaviruses, the lineage C MERS-CoV and the 
      lineage D bCoV-HKU9. The capacity of GRP78 to facilitate surface attachment of 
      both a human coronavirus and a phylogenetically related bat coronavirus 
      exemplifies the need for continuous surveillance of the evolution of animal 
      coronaviruses to monitor their potential for human adaptations.

AB  - The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel enzootic 
      betacoronavirus that was first described in September 2012. The clinical spectrum 
      of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory 
      illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure; overall mortality is around 
      35.7%. Bats harbour several betacoronaviruses that are closely related to 
      MERS-CoV but more research is needed to establish the relationship between bats 
      and MERS-CoV. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is very high in dromedary 
      camels in Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus 
      have been isolated from dromedary camels, including some with respiratory 
      symptoms. Furthermore, near-identical strains of MERS-CoV have been isolated from 
      epidemiologically linked humans and camels, confirming inter-transmission, most 
      probably from camels to humans. Though inter-human spread within health care 
      settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV cases, the virus is 
      incapable at present of causing sustained human-to-human transmission. Clusters 
      can be readily controlled with implementation of appropriate infection control 
      procedures. Phylogenetic and sequencing data strongly suggest that MERS-CoV 
      originated from bat ancestors after undergoing a recombination event in the spike 
      protein, possibly in dromedary camels in Africa, before its exportation to the 
      Arabian Peninsula along the camel trading routes. MERS-CoV serosurveys are needed 
      to investigate possible unrecognized human infections in Africa. Amongst the 
      important measures to control MERS-CoV spread are strict regulation of camel 
      movement, regular herd screening and isolation of infected camels, use of 
      personal protective equipment by camel handlers and enforcing rules banning all 
      consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and urine.

AB  - Acquisition of new proteins by viruses usually occurs through horizontal gene 
      transfer or through gene duplication, but another, less common mechanism is the 
      usage of completely or partially overlapping reading frames. A case of 
      acquisition of a completely new protein through introduction of a start codon in 
      an alternative reading frame is the protein encoded by open reading frame (orf) 
      9b of SARS coronavirus. This gene completely overlaps with the nucleocapsid (N) 
      gene (orf9a). Our findings indicate that the orf9b gene features a discordant 
      codon-usage pattern. We analyzed the evolution of orf9b in concert with orf9a 
      using sequence data of betacoronavirus-lineage b and found that orf9b, which 
      encodes the overprinting protein, evolved largely independent of the overprinted 
      orf9a. We also examined the protein products of these genomic sequences for their 
      structural flexibility and found that it is not necessary for a newly acquired, 
      overlapping protein product to be intrinsically disordered, in contrast to 
      earlier suggestions. Our findings contribute to characterizing sequence 
      properties of newly acquired genes making use of overlapping reading frames.

PG  - 191-202

AB  - The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the discovery of 
      MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 suggests that another SARS-like epidemic is 
      occurring. Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which 
      rapidly disappeared in less than one year, MERS has persisted for over three 
      years. More than 1,600 cases of MERS have been reported worldwide, and the 
      disease carries a worryingly high fatality rate of >30%. A total of 182 MERS-CoV 
      genomes have been sequenced, including 94 from humans and 88 from dromedary 
      camels. The 182 genomes all share >99% identity, indicating minimal variation 
      among MERS-CoV genomes. MERS-CoV is a lineage C Betacoronavirus (ßCoV). MERS-CoV 
      genomes can be roughly divided into two clades: clade A, which contains only a 
      few strains, and clade B, to which most strains belong. In contrast to ORF1ab and 
      structural proteins, the putative proteins encoded by ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 
      and ORF8b in the MERS-CoV genome do not share homology with any known host or 
      virus protein, other than those of its closely related lineage C ßCoVs. Human and 
      dromedary viral genomes have intermingled, indicating that multiple 
      camel-to-human transmission events have occurred. The multiple origins of 
      MERS-CoV suggest that the virus has been resident in dromedaries for many years. 
      This is consistent with the detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary 
      camels as early as the 1980s.

PG  - 20142124

LID - 20142124
AB  - Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that 
      spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how 
      these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is 
      of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to 
      humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution 
      of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and 
      susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also 
      requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. 
      Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg 
      virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from 
      the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that 
      increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect 
      co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may 
      explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: 
      episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that 
      occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also 
      may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the 
      probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from 
      targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and 
      susceptibility.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological 
      agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 10 years ago. 
      SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barriers to infect 
      humans. Bats, which harbour a diverse pool of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs), are 
      believed to be the natural reservoir. The SARS-CoV surface Spike (S) protein is a 
      major antigenic determinant in eliciting neutralizing antibody production during 
      SARS-CoV infection. In our previous work, we showed that a panel of murine 
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the S2 subunit of the S protein are 
      capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro (Lip KM et al, J Virol. 2006 
      Jan; 80(2): 941-50). In this study, we report our findings on the 
      characterization of one of these mAbs, known as 1A9, which binds to the S protein 
      at a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111-1130. MAb 1A9 is a 
      broadly neutralizing mAb that prevents viral entry mediated by the S proteins of 
      human and civet SARS-CoVs as well as bat SL-CoVs. By generating mutant SARS-CoV 
      that escapes the neutralization by mAb 1A9, the residue D1128 in S was found to 
      be crucial for its interaction with mAb 1A9. S protein containing the 
      substitution of D1128 with alanine (D1128A) exhibited a significant decrease in 
      binding capability to mAb 1A9 compared to wild-type S protein. By using a 
      pseudotyped viral entry assay, it was shown that the D1128A substitution in the 
      escape virus allows it to overcome the viral entry blockage by mAb 1A9. In 
      addition, the D1128A mutation was found to exert no effects on the S protein cell 
      surface expression and incorporation into virion particles, suggesting that the 
      escape virus retains the same viral entry property as the wild-type virus.

AB  - Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) causes a lethal systemic granulomatous 
      disease in wild and domestic cats around the world. Currently, no effective 
      vaccines or drugs have been developed against it. As a member of the genus 
      Alphacoronavirus, FIPV encodes two polyprotein precursors required for genome 
      replication and transcription. Each polyprotein undergoes extensive proteolytic 
      processing, resulting in functional subunits. This process is mainly mediated by 
      its genome-encoded main protease, which is an attractive target for antiviral 
      drug design. In this study, the main protease of FIPV in complex with a Michael 
      acceptor-type inhibitor was crystallized. The complex crystals diffracted to 
      2.5 Å resolution and belonged to space group I422, with unit-cell parameters a = 
      112.3, b = 112.3, c = 102.1 Å. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit.

AB  - The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among the Old World leaf-nosed bats 
      (Hipposideridae) and the closely related horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) remain 
      unresolved. In this study, we generated a novel approximately 10-kb molecular 
      data set of 19 nuclear exon and intron gene fragments for 40 bat species to 
      elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the families Rhinolophidae and 
      Hipposideridae. We estimated divergence times and explored potential reasons for 
      any incongruent phylogenetic signal. We demonstrated the effects of outlier taxa 
      and genes on phylogenetic reconstructions and compared the relative performance 
      of intron and exon data to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic 
      analyses produced a well-resolved phylogeny, supporting the familial status of 
      Hipposideridae and demonstrated the paraphyly of the largest genus, Hipposideros. 
      A fossil-calibrated timetree and biogeographical analyses estimated that 
      Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae diverged in Africa during the Eocene 
      approximately 42 Ma. The phylogram, the timetree, and a unique retrotransposon 
      insertion supported the elevation of the subtribe Rhinonycterina to family level 
      and which is diagnosed herein. Comparative analysis of diversification rates 
      showed that the speciose genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros underwent 
      diversification during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. The intron versus exon 
      analyses demonstrated the improved nodal support provided by introns for our 
      optimal tree, an important finding for large-scale phylogenomic studies, which 
      typically rely on exon data alone. With the recent outbreak of Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome, caused by a novel coronavirus, the study of these species 
      is urgent as they are considered the natural reservoir for emergent severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. It has been shown that host 
      phylogeny is the primary factor that determines a virus's persistence, 
      replicative ability, and can act as a predictor of new emerging disease. 
      Therefore, this newly resolved phylogeny can be used to direct future assessments 
      of viral diversity and to elucidate the origin and development of SARS-like 
      coronaviruses in mammals.

TI  - Activation of the chicken type I interferon response by infectious bronchitis 
      coronavirus.
PG  - 1156-67
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02671-14 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses from both the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera interfere 
      with the type I interferon (IFN) response in various ways, ensuring the limited 
      activation of the IFN response in most cell types. Of the gammacoronaviruses that 
      mainly infect birds, little is known about the activation of the host immune 
      response. We show that the prototypical Gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis 
      virus (IBV), induces a delayed activation of the IFN response in primary renal 
      cells, tracheal epithelial cells, and a chicken cell line. In fact, Ifnβ 
      expression is delayed with respect to the peak of viral replication and the 
      accompanying accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In addition, we 
      demonstrate that MDA5 is the primary sensor for Gammacoronavirus infections in 
      chicken cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that accessory proteins 3a and 3b 
      of IBV modulate the response at the transcriptional and translational levels. 
      Finally, we show that, despite the lack of activation of the IFN response during 
      the early phase of IBV infection, the signaling of nonself dsRNA through both 
      MDA5 and TLR3 remains intact in IBV-infected cells. Taken together, this study 
      provides the first comprehensive analysis of host-virus interactions of a 
      Gammacoronavirus with avian innate immune responses. IMPORTANCE: Our results 
      demonstrate that IBV has evolved multiple strategies to avoid the activation of 
      the type I interferon response. Taken together, the present study closes a gap in 
      the understanding of host-IBV interaction and paves the way for further 
      characterization of the mechanisms underlying immune evasion strategies as well 
      as the pathogenesis of gammacoronaviruses.

PG  - 396

LID - 396
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining 
      inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat 
      species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor 
      coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest 
      Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their 
      proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the 
      phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. 
      RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 
      different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as 
      PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3-16.8]. CoV RNA 
      was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three 
      Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- 
      CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted 
      co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis 
      nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. 
      ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically 
      for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in 
      Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously 
      unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique 
      report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand 
      the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel 
      bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals 
      and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European 
      bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific 
      geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close 
      proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control 
      measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of 
      bats and their habitats.

TI  - Group B betacoronavirus in rhinolophid bats, Japan.
PG  - 1267-9
AB  - We report group B Betacoronavirus infection in little Japanese horseshoe bats in 
      Iwate prefecture. We then used reverse-transcription PCR to look for the 
      coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene in fecal samples collected from 27 
      little Japanese horseshoe bats and found eight were provisionally positive. We 
      had a success in the nucleotide sequencing of six of the eight positive samples 
      and compared them with those of authentic coronaviruses. We found that these six 
      samples were positive in coronavirus infection, and they belonged to the group B 
      Betacornavirus by phylogenetic analysis. Virus isolation using the Vero cell 
      culture was unsuccessful. Pathogenic trait of these bat coronaviruses remained 
      unexplored.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially isolated 
      from a Saudi Arabian man with fatal pneumonia. Since the original case in 2012, 
      MERS-CoV infections have been reported in >1500 humans, and the case fatality 
      rate is currently 35%. This lineage C betacoronavirus has been reported to cause 
      a wide range of disease severity in humans, ranging from asymptomatic to 
      progressive fatal pneumonia that may be accompanied by renal or multiorgan 
      failure. Although the clinical presentation of human MERS-CoV infection has been 
      documented, many facets of this emerging disease are still unknown and could be 
      studied with animal models. Several animal models of MERS-CoV have been 
      developed, including New Zealand white rabbits, transduced or transgenic mice 
      that express human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets. 
      This review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on human 
      MERS-CoV infections, the probable origin of MERS-CoV, and the available animal 
      models of MERS-CoV infection. Evaluation of the benefits and limitations of these 
      models will aid in appropriate model selection for studying viral pathogenesis 
      and transmission, as well as for testing vaccines and antivirals against 
      MERS-CoV.

AB  - In 2012 in Jordan, infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused the first known 
      cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). MERS-CoV sequences have since 
      been found in a bat and the virus appears to be enzootic among dromedary camels 
      across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa. The majority of human cases 
      have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In humans, the etiologic 
      agent, MERS-CoV, has been detected in severe, mild and influenza-like illness and 
      in those without any obvious signs or symptoms of disease. MERS is often a lower 
      respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, 
      pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan 
      failure and death among more than a third of those infected. Severe disease is 
      usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of 
      MERS. Compared to SARS, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and 
      acute kidney injury, is more often observed as severe disease in patients with 
      underlying illnesses and is more often fatal. MERS-CoV has a broader tropism than 
      SARS-CoV, rapidly triggers cellular damage, employs a different receptor and 
      induces a delayed proinflammatory response in cells. Most human cases have been 
      linked to lapses in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, with 
      a fifth of virus detections reported among healthcare workers. This review sets 
      out what is currently known about MERS and the MERS-CoV, summarises the new 
      phenomenon of crowd-sourced epidemiology and lists some of the many questions 
      that remain unanswered, nearly three years after the first reported case.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an acute viral respiratory illness 
      with high mortality caused by a new strain of betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since 
      the report of the first patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012, large-scale outbreaks 
      through hospital-acquired infection and inter-hospital transmission have been 
      reported. Most of the patients reported in South Korea were also infected in 
      hospital settings. Therefore, to eliminate the spread of MERS-CoV, infection 
      prevention and control measures should be implemented with rigor. The present 
      guideline has been drafted on the basis of the experiences of infection control 
      in the South Korean hospitals involved in the recent MERS outbreak and on 
      domestic and international infection prevention and control guidelines. To ensure 
      efficient MERS-CoV infection prevention and control, care should be taken to 
      provide comprehensive infection control measures including contact control, hand 
      hygiene, personal protective equipment, disinfection, and environmental cleaning.

AB  - Structure predictions suggest a partial conservation of RNA structure elements in 
      coronavirus terminal genome regions. Here, we determined the structures of 
      stem-loops (SL) 1 and 2 of two alphacoronaviruses, human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E 
      and NL63, by RNA structure probing and studied the functional relevance of these 
      putative cis-acting elements. HCoV-229E SL1 and SL2 mutants generated by reverse 
      genetics were used to study the effects on viral replication of single-nucleotide 
      substitutions predicted to destabilize the SL1 and SL2 structures. The data 
      provide conclusive evidence for the critical role of SL1 and SL2 in HCoV-229E 
      replication and, in some cases, revealed parallels with previously characterized 
      betacoronavirus SL1 and SL2 elements. Also, we were able to rescue viable 
      HCoV-229E mutants carrying replacements of SL2 with equivalent betacoronavirus 
      structural elements. The data obtained in this study reveal a remarkable degree 
      of structural and functional conservation of 5'-terminal RNA structural elements 
      across coronavirus genus boundaries.

AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), identified in 2012, is a common enteropathogen 
      of swine with worldwide distribution. The source and evolutionary history of this 
      virus is, however, unknown. PDCoV belongs to the Deltacoronavirus genus that 
      comprises predominantly avian CoV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that PDCoV 
      originated relatively recently from a host-switching event between birds and 
      mammals. Insight into receptor engagement by PDCoV may shed light into such an 
      exceptional phenomenon. Here we report that PDCoV employs host aminopeptidase N 
      (APN) as an entry receptor and interacts with APN via domain B of its spike (S) 
      protein. Infection of porcine cells with PDCoV was drastically reduced by APN 
      knockout and rescued after reconstitution of APN expression. In addition, we 
      observed that PDCoV efficiently infects cells of unusual broad species range, 
      including human and chicken. Accordingly, PDCoV S was found to target the 
      phylogenetically conserved catalytic domain of APN. Moreover, transient 
      expression of porcine, feline, human, and chicken APN renders cells susceptible 
      to PDCoV infection. Binding of PDCoV to an interspecies conserved site on APN may 
      facilitate direct transmission of PDCoV to nonreservoir species, including 
      humans, potentially reflecting the mechanism that enabled a virus, ancestral to 
      PDCoV, to breach the species barrier between birds and mammals. The APN cell 
      surface protein is also used by several members of the Alphacoronavirus genus. 
      Hence, our data constitute the second identification of CoVs from different 
      genera that use the same receptor, implying that CoV receptor selection is 
      subjected to specific restrictions that are still poorly understood.

TI  - Shared Common Ancestry of Rodent Alphacoronaviruses Sampled Globally.
LID - 10.3390/v11020125 [doi]
LID - 125
AB  - The recent discovery of novel alphacoronaviruses (alpha-CoVs) in European and 
      Asian rodents revealed that rodent coronaviruses (CoVs) sampled worldwide formed 
      a discrete phylogenetic group within this genus. To determine the evolutionary 
      history of rodent CoVs in more detail, particularly the relative frequencies of 
      virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission, we recovered longer 
      fragments of CoV genomes from previously discovered European rodent alpha-CoVs 
      using a combination of PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Accordingly, the full 
      genome sequence was retrieved from the UK rat coronavirus, along with partial 
      genome sequences from the UK field vole and Poland-resident bank vole CoVs, and a 
      short conserved ORF1b fragment from the French rabbit CoV. Genome and 
      phylogenetic analysis showed that despite their diverse geographic origins, all 
      rodent alpha-CoVs formed a single monophyletic group and shared similar features, 
      such as the same gene constellations, a recombinant beta-CoV spike gene, and 
      similar core transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). These data suggest that 
      all rodent alpha CoVs sampled so far originate from a single common ancestor, and 
      that there has likely been a long-term association between alpha CoVs and 
      rodents. Despite this likely antiquity, the phylogenetic pattern of the 
      alpha-CoVs was also suggestive of relatively frequent host-jumping among the 
      different rodent species.

LID - 10.1111/zph.12271 [doi]
AB  - Bats have been demonstrated to be natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV. 
      Faecal samples from 248 individuals of 20 bat species were tested for partial 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of CoV and 57 faecal samples from eight bat 
      species were tested positive. The highest detection rate of 44% for Scotophilus 
      kuhlii, followed by 30% for Rhinolophus monoceros. Significantly higher detection 
      rates of coronaviral RNA were found in female bats and Scotophilus kuhlii 
      roosting in palm trees. Phylogenetic analysis classified the positive samples 
      into SARS-related (SARSr) CoV, Scotophilus bat CoV 512 close to those from China 
      and Philippines, and Miniopterus bat CoV 1A-related lineages. Coronaviral RNA was 
      also detected in bat guano from Scotophilus kuhlii and Myotis formosus flavus on 
      the ground and had potential risk for human exposure. Diverse bat CoV with 
      zoonotic potential could be introduced by migratory bats and maintained in the 
      endemic bat population in Taiwan.

TI  - Genetic diversity of coronaviruses in Miniopterus fuliginosus bats.
PG  - 604-14
LID - 10.1007/s11427-016-5039-0 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pose significant public health threats. 
      Bats have been suggested to act as natural reservoirs for both these viruses, and 
      periodic monitoring of coronaviruses in bats may thus provide important clues 
      about emergent infectious viruses. The Eastern bent-wing bat Miniopterus 
      fuliginosus is distributed extensively throughout China. We therefore analyzed 
      the genetic diversity of coronaviruses in samples of M. fuliginosus collected 
      from nine Chinese provinces during 2011-2013. The only coronavirus genus found 
      was Alphacoronavirus. We established six complete and five partial genomic 
      sequences of alphacoronaviruses, which revealed that they could be divided into 
      two distinct lineages, with close relationships to coronaviruses in Miniopterus 
      magnater and Miniopterus pusillus. Recombination was confirmed by detecting 
      putative breakpoints of Lineage 1 coronaviruses in M. fuliginosus and M. pusillus 
      (Wu et al., 2015), which supported the results of topological and phylogenetic 
      analyses. The established alphacoronavirus genome sequences showed high 
      similarity to other alphacoronaviruses found in other Miniopterus species, 
      suggesting that their transmission in different Miniopterus species may provide 
      opportunities for recombination with different alphacoronaviruses. The genetic 
      information for these novel alphacoronaviruses will improve our understanding of 
      the evolution and genetic diversity of coronaviruses, with potentially important 
      implications for the transmission of human diseases.

TI  - SARS-unique fold in the Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9.
PG  - 1726-1737
LID - 10.1002/pro.3208 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) is a multifunctional protein that 
      comprises multiple structural domains. This protein assists viral polyprotein 
      cleavage, host immune interference, and may play other roles in genome 
      replication or transcription. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of a 
      protein from the "SARS-unique region" of the bat coronavirus HKU9. The protein 
      contains a frataxin fold or double-wing motif, which is an α + β fold that is 
      associated with protein/protein interactions, DNA binding, and metal ion binding. 
      High structural similarity to the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
      coronavirus nsp3 is present. A possible functional site that is conserved among 
      some betacoronaviruses has been identified using bioinformatics and biochemical 
      analyses. This structure provides strong experimental support for the recent 
      proposal advanced by us and others that the "SARS-unique" region is not unique to 
      the human SARS virus, but is conserved among several different phylogenetic 
      groups of coronaviruses and provides essential functions.

TI  - Lysosomal Proteases Are a Determinant of Coronavirus Tropism.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01504-18 [doi]
LID - e01504-18
AB  - Cell entry by coronaviruses involves two principal steps, receptor binding and 
      membrane fusion; the latter requires activation by host proteases, particularly 
      lysosomal proteases. Despite the importance of lysosomal proteases in both 
      coronavirus entry and cell metabolism, the correlation between lysosomal 
      proteases and cell tropism of coronaviruses has not been established. Here, we 
      examined the roles of lysosomal proteases in activating coronavirus surface spike 
      proteins for membrane fusion, using the spike proteins from severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as the model system. To this end, we controlled the 
      contributions from receptor binding and other host proteases, thereby attributing 
      coronavirus entry solely or mainly to the efficiency of lysosomal proteases in 
      activating coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion. Our results showed that 
      lysosomal proteases from bat cells support coronavirus spike-mediated pseudovirus 
      entry and cell-cell fusion more effectively than their counterparts from human 
      cells. Moreover, purified lysosomal extracts from bat cells cleave cell 
      surface-expressed coronavirus spikes more efficiently than their counterparts 
      from human cells. Overall, our study suggests that different lysosomal protease 
      activities from different host species and tissue cells are an important 
      determinant of the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE 
      Coronaviruses are capable of colonizing new species, as evidenced by the recent 
      emergence of SARS and MERS coronaviruses; they can also infect multiple tissues 
      in the same species. Lysosomal proteases play critical roles in coronavirus entry 
      by cleaving coronavirus surface spike proteins and activating the fusion of host 
      and viral membranes; they also play critical roles in cell physiology by 
      processing cellular products. How do different lysosomal protease activities from 
      different cells impact coronavirus entry? Here, we controlled the contributions 
      from known factors that function in coronavirus entry so that lysosomal protease 
      activities became the only or the main determinant of coronavirus entry. Using 
      pseudovirus entry, cell-cell fusion, and biochemical assays, we showed that 
      lysosomal proteases from bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane 
      fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. Our study 
      provides the first direct evidence supporting lysosomal proteases as a 
      determinant of the species and tissue tropisms of coronaviruses.

LID - 10.1111/tbed.12630 [doi]
AB  - Equine coronaviruses (ECoV) are the only coronavirus known to infect horses. So 
      far, data on ECoV infection in horses remain limited to the USA, France and Japan 
      and its geographic distribution is not well understood. We carried out RT-PCR on 
      306 nasal and 315 rectal swabs and tested 243 sera for antibodies to detect 
      coronavirus infections in apparently healthy horses in Saudi Arabia and Oman. We 
      document evidence of infection with ECoV and HKU23 coronavirus by RT-PCR. There 
      was no conclusive evidence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      infection in horses. Serological data suggest that lineage A betacoronavirus 
      infections are commonly infecting horses in Saudi Arabia and Oman but antibody 
      cross-reactivities between these viruses do not permit us to use serological data 
      alone to identify which coronaviruses are causing these infections.

TI  - Genetic Characteristics of Coronaviruses from Korean Bats in 2016.
PG  - 174-182
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1033-8 [doi]
AB  - Bats have increasingly been recognized as the natural reservoir of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus, and other coronaviruses found in 
      mammals. However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in 
      South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 
      urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat 
      sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific 
      coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. 
      Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from 
      one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass 
      (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the 
      genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously 
      known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen 
      sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide 
      identity (97.1-99.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five 
      sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide 
      sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1-95.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong 
      Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity 
      (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China. These results suggest that careful 
      surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued, because animal and 
      human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus 
      reservoirs.

      camels.
LID - 10.1002/rmv.1917 [doi]
LID - e1917
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is caused by a novel 
      betacoronavirus that was isolated in late 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The viral 
      infections have been reported in more than 1700 humans, ranging from asymptomatic 
      or mild cases to severe pneumonia with a mortality rate of 40%. It is well 
      documented now that dromedary camels contract the infection and shed the virus 
      without notable symptoms, and such animals had been infected by at least the 
      early 1980s. The mechanism of camel to human transmission is still not clear, but 
      several primary cases have been associated with camel contact. There is no 
      approved antiviral drug or vaccine against MERS-CoV despite the active research 
      in this area. Vaccine candidates have been developed using various platforms and 
      regimens and have been tested in several animal models. Here, this article 
      reviews the published studies on MERS-CoV vaccines with more focus on vaccines 
      tested in large animals, including camels. It is foreseeable that the 1-health 
      approach could be the best way of tackling the MERS-CoV endemic in the Arabian 
      Peninsula, by using the mass vaccination of camels in the affected areas to block 
      camel to human transmission. Camel vaccines can be developed in a faster time 
      with fewer regulations and lower costs and could clear this virus from the 
      Arabian Peninsula if accompanied by efficient public health measures.

AB  - Since the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak prompted a 
      search for the natural reservoir of the SARS coronavirus, numerous alpha- and 
      betacoronaviruses have been discovered in bats around the world. Bats are likely 
      the natural reservoir of alpha- and betacoronaviruses, and due to the rich 
      diversity and global distribution of bats, the number of bat coronaviruses will 
      likely increase. We conducted a surveillance of coronaviruses in bats in an 
      abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, China, from 2012-2013. 
      Six bat species were frequently detected in the cave: Rhinolophus sinicus, 
      Rhinolophus affinis, Hipposideros pomona, Miniopterus schreibersii, Miniopterus 
      fuliginosus, and Miniopterus fuscus. By sequencing PCR products of the 
      coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp), we found a high frequency 
      of infection by a diverse group of coronaviruses in different bat species in the 
      mineshaft. Sequenced partial RdRp fragments had 80%-99% nucleic acid sequence 
      identity with well-characterized Alphacoronavirus species, including BtCoV HKU2, 
      BtCoV HKU8, and BtCoV1, and unassigned species BtCoV HKU7 and BtCoV HKU10. 
      Additionally, the surveillance identified two unclassified betacoronaviruses, one 
      new strain of SARS-like coronavirus, and one potentially new betacoronavirus 
      species. Furthermore, coronavirus co-infection was detected in all six bat 
      species, a phenomenon that fosters recombination and promotes the emergence of 
      novel virus strains. Our findings highlight the importance of bats as natural 
      reservoirs of coronaviruses and the potentially zoonotic source of viral 
      pathogens.

AB  - To help reveal the diversity and evolution of bat coronaviruses we collected 1067 
      bats from 21 species in China. A total of 73 coronaviruses (32 alphacoronaviruses 
      and 41 betacoronaviruses) were identified in these bats, with an overall 
      prevalence of 6.84%. All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related 
      Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception 
      of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou 
      province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, 
      the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some 
      may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights 
      into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general 
      clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species 
      transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the 
      alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Overall, these data suggest that high 
      contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of 
      coronaviruses.

AB  - Although rodents are important reservoirs for RNA viruses, to date only one 
      species of rodent coronavirus (CoV) has been identified. Herein, we describe a 
      new CoV, denoted Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), and novel variants of two 
      Betacoronavirus species termed Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus (LAMV) and Longquan 
      Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV), that were identified in a survey of 1465 rodents 
      sampled in China during 2011-2013. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LAMV and 
      LRLV fell into lineage A of the genus Betacoronavirus, which included CoVs 
      discovered in humans and domestic and wild animals. In contrast, LRNV harbored by 
      Rattus norvegicus formed a distinct lineage within the genus Alphacoronavirus in 
      the 3CL(pro), RdRp, and Hel gene trees, but formed a more divergent lineage in 
      the N and S gene trees, indicative of a recombinant origin. Additional 
      recombination events were identified in LRLV. Together, these data suggest that 
      rodents may carry additional unrecognized CoVs.

TI  - Disease features of equine coronavirus and enteric salmonellosis are similar in 
      horses.
PG  - 912-917
LID - 10.1111/jvim.15386 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is an emerging pathogen associated with 
      fever and enteric disease in adult horses. Clinical features of ECoV infection 
      have been described, but no study has compared these features to those of 
      Salmonella infections. OBJECTIVES: Compare the clinical features of ECoV 
      infection with enteric salmonellosis and establish a disease signature to 
      increase clinical suspicion of ECoV infection in adult horses. ANIMALS: 
      Forty-three horses >1 year of age with results of CBC, serum biochemistry, and 
      fecal diagnostic testing for ECoV and Salmonella spp. METHODS: Medical records of 
      horses presented to the North Carolina State University Equine and Farm Animal 
      Veterinary Center (2003-016) were retrospectively reviewed. Horses were divided 
      into 3 groups based on fecal diagnostic test results: ECoV-positive, 
      Salmonella-positive, or unknown diagnosis (UNK). Time of year presented, clinical 
      signs, CBC, and serum biochemistry test results were recorded. Data were analyzed 
      by 1-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, or Fisher's exact test with 
      significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: Most common presenting complaints were 
      fever and colic and were similar across groups. Horses with ECoV had 
      significantly decreased neutrophil counts when compared to those with no 
      diagnosis but were not different from horses with Salmonella. Horses with 
      Salmonella had significantly lower mean leukocyte counts compared to those with 
      UNK. No significant differences were found among groups for any other examined 
      variable. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Equine coronavirus and Salmonella 
      infections share clinical features, suggesting both diseases should be 
      differential diagnoses for horses with fever and enteric clinical signs.

AB  - The recently reported Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is 
      phylogenetically closely related to the bat coronaviruses (BatCoVs) HKU4 and 
      HKU5. However, the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV is still unclear. A receptor 
      binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV envelope-embedded spike protein specifically 
      engages human CD26 (hCD26) to initiate viral entry. The high sequence identity in 
      the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if HKU4 and HKU5 can recognize 
      hCD26 for cell entry. We found that HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, binds to hCD26, 
      and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU4 spike can infect cells via hCD26 
      recognition. The structure of the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 complex revealed a hCD26-binding 
      mode similar overall to that observed for MERS-RBD. HKU4-RBD, however, is less 
      adapted to hCD26 than MERS-RBD, explaining its lower affinity for receptor 
      binding. Our findings support a bat origin for MERS-CoV and indicate the need for 
      surveillance of HKU4-related viruses in bats.

AB  - Because some bats host viruses with zoonotic potential, we investigated human-bat 
      interactions in rural Ghana during 2011-2012. Nearly half (46.6%) of respondents 
      regularly visited bat caves; 37.4% had been bitten, scratched, or exposed to bat 
      urine; and 45.6% ate bat meat. Human-bat interactions in rural Ghana are frequent 
      and diverse.

TI  - Identification of Alpha and Beta Coronavirus in Wildlife Species in France: Bats, 
      Rodents, Rabbits, and Hedgehogs.
LID - 10.3390/v9120364 [doi]
LID - 364
AB  - Coronaviruses are closely monitored in the context of emerging diseases and, as 
      illustrated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are known to cross the 
      species barrier and eventually to move from wildlife to humans. Knowledge of the 
      diversity of coronaviruses in wildlife is therefore essential to better 
      understand and prevent emergence events. This study explored the presence of 
      coronaviruses in four wild mammal orders in France: Bats, rodents, lagomorphs, 
      and hedgehogs. Betacoronavirus and Alphacoronavirus genera were identified. The 
      results obtained suggest the circulation of potentially evolving virus strains, 
      with the potential to cross the species barrier.

TI  - Discovery of a novel coronavirus, China Rattus coronavirus HKU24, from Norway 
      rats supports the murine origin of Betacoronavirus 1 and has implications for the 
      ancestor of Betacoronavirus lineage A.
PG  - 3076-92
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02420-14 [doi]
AB  - We discovered a novel Betacoronavirus lineage A coronavirus, China Rattus 
      coronavirus (ChRCoV) HKU24, from Norway rats in China. ChRCoV HKU24 occupied a 
      deep branch at the root of members of Betacoronavirus 1, being distinct from 
      murine coronavirus and human coronavirus HKU1. Its unique putative cleavage sites 
      between nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 and in the spike (S) protein and low 
      sequence identities to other lineage A betacoronaviruses (βCoVs) in conserved 
      replicase domains support ChRCoV HKU24 as a separate species. ChRCoV HKU24 
      possessed genome features that resemble those of both Betacoronavirus 1 and 
      murine coronavirus, being closer to Betacoronavirus 1 in most predicted proteins 
      but closer to murine coronavirus by G+C content, the presence of a single 
      nonstructural protein (NS4), and an absent transcription regulatory sequence for 
      the envelope (E) protein. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) demonstrated higher 
      sequence identity to the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) NTD than to the mouse 
      hepatitis virus (MHV) NTD, with 3 of 4 critical sugar-binding residues in BCoV 
      and 2 of 14 contact residues at the MHV NTD/murine CEACAM1a interface being 
      conserved. Molecular clock analysis dated the time of the most recent common 
      ancestor of ChRCoV HKU24, Betacoronavirus 1, and rabbit coronavirus HKU14 to 
      about the year 1400. Cross-reactivities between other lineage A and B βCoVs and 
      ChRCoV HKU24 nucleocapsid but not spike polypeptide were demonstrated. Using the 
      spike polypeptide-based Western blot assay, we showed that only Norway rats and 
      two oriental house rats from Guangzhou, China, were infected by ChRCoV HKU24. 
      Other rats, including Norway rats from Hong Kong, possessed antibodies only 
      against N protein and not against the spike polypeptide, suggesting infection by 
      βCoVs different from ChRCoV HKU24. ChRCoV HKU24 may represent the murine origin 
      of Betacoronavirus 1, and rodents are likely an important reservoir for ancestors 
      of lineage A βCoVs. IMPORTANCE: While bats and birds are hosts for ancestors of 
      most coronaviruses (CoVs), lineage A βCoVs have never been found in these animals 
      and the origin of Betacoronavirus lineage A remains obscure. We discovered a 
      novel lineage A βCoV, China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV HKU24), from Norway 
      rats in China with a high seroprevalence. The unique genome features and 
      phylogenetic analysis supported the suggestion that ChRCoV HKU24 represents a 
      novel CoV species, occupying a deep branch at the root of members of 
      Betacoronavirus 1 and being distinct from murine coronavirus. Nevertheless, 
      ChRCoV HKU24 possessed genome characteristics that resemble those of both 
      Betacoronavirus 1 and murine coronavirus. Our data suggest that ChRCoV HKU24 
      represents the murine origin of Betacoronavirus 1, with interspecies transmission 
      from rodents to other mammals having occurred centuries ago, before the emergence 
      of human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 in the late 1800s. Rodents are likely an 
      important reservoir for ancestors of lineage A βCoVs.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been shown to infect 
      both humans and dromedary camels using dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as its 
      receptor. The distribution of DPP4 in the respiratory tract tissues of humans and 
      camels reflects MERS-CoV tropism. Apart from dromedary camels, insectivorous bats 
      are suggested as another natural reservoir for MERS-like-CoVs. In order to gain 
      insight on the tropism of these viruses in bats, we studied the DPP4 distribution 
      in the respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues of two frugivorous bat species 
      (Epomophorus gambianus and Rousettus aegyptiacus) and two insectivorous bat 
      species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus serotinus). In the frugivorous 
      bats, DPP4 was present in epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the 
      intestinal tract, similar to what has been reported for camels and humans. In the 
      insectivorous bats, however, DPP4 expression in epithelial cells of the 
      respiratory tract was almost absent. The preferential expression of DPP4 in the 
      intestinal tract of insectivorous bats, suggests that transmission of 
      MERS-like-CoVs mainly occurs via the fecal-oral route. Our results highlight 
      differences in the distribution of DPP4 expression among MERS-CoV susceptible 
      species, which might influence variability in virus tropism, pathogenesis and 
      transmission route.

AB  - Bats have been shown to serve as natural reservoirs for numerous emerging viruses 
      including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In the 
      present study, we report the discovery of bat CoV genes in Indonesian Moluccan 
      naked-backed fruit bats (Dobsonia moluccensis). A partial RNA-dependent RNA 
      polymerase gene sequence was detected in feces and tissues samples from the fruit 
      bats, and the region between the RdRp and helicase genes could also be amplified 
      from fecal samples. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these bat CoVs are 
      related to members of the genus Betacoronavirus.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology and evolutionary histories of human coronavirus OC43 and 
      HKU1 among patients with upper respiratory tract infections in Kuala Lumpur, 
      Malaysia.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/s12985-016-0488-4 [doi]
LID - 33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the worldwide circulation of human coronavirus OC43 
      (HCoV-OC43) and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), data on their molecular epidemiology and 
      evolutionary dynamics in the tropical Southeast Asia region is lacking. METHODS: 
      The study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, temporal distribution, 
      population history and clinical symptoms of betacoronavirus infections in Kuala 
      Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2013. A total of 2,060 adults presented with 
      acute respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of betacoronaviruses 
      using multiplex PCR. The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and 1a genes were 
      sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. 
      RESULTS: A total of 48/2060 (2.4 %) specimens were tested positive for HCoV-OC43 
      (1.3 %) and HCoV-HKU1 (1.1 %). Both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were co-circulating 
      throughout the year, with the lowest detection rates reported in the 
      October-January period. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene showed that the 
      majority of HCoV-OC43 isolates were grouped into two previously undefined 
      genotypes, provisionally assigned as novel lineage 1 and novel lineage 2. Sign of 
      natural recombination was observed in these potentially novel lineages. Location 
      mapping showed that the novel lineage 1 is currently circulating in Malaysia, 
      Thailand, Japan and China, while novel lineage 2 can be found in Malaysia and 
      China. Molecular dating showed the origin of HCoV-OC43 around late 1950s, before 
      it diverged into genotypes A (1960s), B (1990s), and other genotypes (2000s). 
      Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 27.3 % of the HCoV-HKU1 strains belong to 
      genotype A while 72.7 % belongs to genotype B. The tree root of HCoV-HKU1 was 
      similar to that of HCoV-OC43, with the tMRCA of genotypes A and B estimated 
      around the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Correlation of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 
      with the severity of respiratory symptoms was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present study reported the molecular complexity and evolutionary dynamics of 
      human betacoronaviruses among adults with acute respiratory symptoms in a 
      tropical country. Two novel HCoV-OC43 genetic lineages were identified, 
      warranting further investigation on their genotypic and phenotypic 
      characteristics.

AB  - Canine coronavirus types I (CCoV-I) and II (CCoV-II) are usually responsible for 
      mild enteritis in dogs. While the CCoV-II genome has been completely sequenced, 
      to date there are no complete genomic sequence data available publicly for 
      CCoV-I. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the full-length genome 
      of a CCoV-I prototype strain that had been recovered from a dog with diarrhea in 
      Italy. CCoV-I strain 23/03 has a genome of 30,000 nucleotides, excluding the 3' 
      poly(A) tail, displaying the typical Alphacoronavirus-1 organization and the 
      highest genetic relatedness to CCoV-II. However, two distinct features were 
      observed in the CCoV-I genome: (i) the presence of an additional ORF between the 
      spike (S) protein gene and ORF3a; (ii) the diversity of the S protein, which is 
      more closely related to that of feline coronavirus type I and presents a furin 
      cleavage site. The present study may contribute to a better understanding of the 
      Alphacoronavirus-1 evolutionary pattern and may be paradigmatic of how 
      coronaviruses evolve through gene losses, acquisition and exchanges among 
      different members.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, 
      has caused significant damage to the Asian and American pork industries. 
      Coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which is involved in the processing of 
      viral polyproteins for viral replication, is an appealing antiviral drug target. 
      Here, we present the crystal structures of PEDV 3CL(pro) and a molecular complex 
      between an inactive PEDV 3CL(pro) variant C144A bound to a peptide substrate. 
      Structural characterization, mutagenesis and biochemical analysis reveal the 
      substrate-binding pockets and the residues that comprise the active site of PEDV 
      3CL(pro). The dimerization of PEDV 3CL(pro) is similar to that of other 
      Alphacoronavirus 3CL(pro)s but has several differences from that of SARS-CoV 
      3CL(pro) from the genus Betacoronavirus. Furthermore, the non-conserved motifs in 
      the pockets cause different cleavage of substrate between PEDV and SARS-CoV 
      3CL(pro)s, which may provide new insights into the recognition of substrates by 
      3CL(pro)s in various coronavirus genera.

TI  - Detection of potentially novel paramyxovirus and coronavirus viral RNA in bats 
      and rats in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam.
PG  - 30-42
LID - 10.1111/zph.12362 [doi]
AB  - Bats and rodents are being increasingly recognized as reservoirs of emerging 
      zoonotic viruses. Various studies have investigated bat viruses in tropical 
      regions, but to date there are no data regarding viruses with zoonotic potential 
      that circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. To address this paucity of 
      data, we sampled three bat farms and three wet markets trading in rat meat in the 
      Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam. Faecal and urine samples were screened 
      for the presence of RNA from paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses. 
      Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 4 of 248 (1%) and 11 of 222 (4.9%) bat faecal 
      and urine samples, respectively. Coronavirus RNA was detected in 55 of 248 (22%) 
      of bat faecal samples; filovirus RNA was not detected in any of the bat samples. 
      Further, coronavirus RNA was detected in 12 of 270 (4.4%) of rat faecal samples; 
      all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
      that the bat paramyxoviruses and bat and rat coronaviruses were related to 
      viruses circulating in bat and rodent populations globally, but showed no 
      cross-species mixing of viruses between bat and rat populations within Viet Nam. 
      Our study shows that potentially novel variants of paramyxoviruses and 
      coronaviruses commonly circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. Further 
      characterization of the viruses and additional human and animal surveillance is 
      required to evaluate the likelihood of viral spillover and to assess whether 
      these viruses pose a risk to human health.

TI  - Broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734 inhibits both epidemic and zoonotic 
      coronaviruses.

AB  - Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members 
      periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the 
      development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs) 
      have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. 
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory 
      disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. 
      Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an 
      immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging 
      and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently 
      in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit 
      SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary 
      human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC(50) values. GS-5734 
      was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating 
      contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating 
      broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, 
      prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly 
      reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as 
      respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may 
      prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human 
      CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.

AB  - Cyclophilin A (CypA) is an important host factor in the replication of a variety 
      of RNA viruses. Also the replication of several nidoviruses was reported to 
      depend on CypA, although possibly not to the same extent. These prior studies are 
      difficult to compare, since different nidoviruses, cell lines and experimental 
      set-ups were used. Here, we investigated the CypA dependence of three distantly 
      related nidoviruses that can all replicate in Huh7 cells: the arterivirus equine 
      arteritis virus (EAV), the alphacoronavirus human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), 
      and the betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
      The replication of these viruses was compared in the same parental Huh7 cells and 
      in CypA-knockout Huh7 cells generated using CRISPR/Cas9-technology. CypA 
      depletion reduced EAV yields by ~ 3-log, whereas MERS-CoV progeny titers were 
      modestly reduced (3-fold) and HCoV-229E replication was unchanged. This study 
      reveals that the replication of nidoviruses can differ strikingly in its 
      dependence on cellular CypA.

TI  - Neotropical Bats from Costa Rica harbour Diverse Coronaviruses.
PG  - 501-5
LID - 10.1111/zph.12181 [doi]
AB  - Bats are hosts of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) known to potentially cross the 
      host-species barrier. For analysing coronavirus diversity in a bat species-rich 
      country, a total of 421 anal swabs/faecal samples from Costa Rican bats were 
      screened for CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences by a 
      pancoronavirus PCR. Six families, 24 genera and 41 species of bats were analysed. 
      The detection rate for CoV was 1%. Individuals (n = 4) from four different 
      species of frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia perspicillata and Carollia 
      castanea) and nectivorous (Glossophaga soricina) bats were positive for 
      coronavirus-derived nucleic acids. Analysis of 440 nt. RdRp sequences allocated 
      all Costa Rican bat CoVs to the α-CoV group. Several CoVs sequences clustered 
      near previously described CoVs from the same species of bat, but were 
      phylogenetically distant from the human CoV sequences identified to date, 
      suggesting no recent spillover events. The Glossophaga soricina CoV sequence is 
      sufficiently dissimilar (26% homology to the closest known bat CoVs) to represent 
      a unique coronavirus not clustering near other CoVs found in the same bat species 
      so far, implying an even higher CoV diversity than previously suspected.

AB  - Coronaviruses have a wide host range and can cause a variety of diseases with 
      varying severity in different animals. Several enteric coronaviruses have been 
      identified that are associated with diarrhea in swine and that have caused 
      substantial economic losses. In this study, a newly emerged porcine enteric 
      alphacoronavirus (PEAV), PEAV-GD-CH/2017, was identified from suckling piglets 
      with diarrhea in southern China, and a full-length genome sequence of PEAV was 
      obtained for systematic analysis. The novel PEAV sequence was most identical to 
      that of bat-HKU2, and the differences between them were comprehensively compared, 
      especially the uniform features of the S protein, which was shown to have a close 
      relationship with betacoronaviruses and to perhaps represent unrecognized 
      betacoronaviruses. In addition, Bayesian analysis was conducted to address the 
      origin of PEAV, and the divergence time between PEAV and bat-HKU2 was estimated 
      at 1926, which indicates that PEAV is not newly emerged and may have circulated 
      in swine herds for several decades since the interspecies transmission of this 
      coronavirus from bat to swine. The evolutionary rate of coronaviruses was 
      estimated to be 1.93 × 10(-4) substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene 
      in our analysis. For the origin of PEAV, we suspect that it is the result of the 
      interspecies transmission of bat-HKU2 from bat to swine. Our results provide 
      valuable information about the uniform features, origin and evolution of the 
      novel PEAV, which will facilitate further investigations of this newly emerged 
      pathogen.

TI  - Computational modeling of the bat HKU4 coronavirus 3CL(pro) inhibitors as a tool 
      for the development of antivirals against the emerging Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.
LID - 10.1002/jmr.2644 [doi]
LID - e2644
AB  - The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus 
      that poses a major challenge to clinical management. The 3C-like protease 
      (3CL(pro) ) is essential for viral replication and thus represents a potential 
      target for antiviral drug development. Presently, very few data are available on 
      MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition by small molecules. We conducted extensive 
      exploration of the pharmacophoric space of a recently identified set of 
      peptidomimetic inhibitors of the bat HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) . HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) shares 
      high sequence identity (81%) with the MERS-CoV enzyme and thus represents a 
      potential surrogate model for anti-MERS drug discovery. We used 2 
      well-established methods: Quantitative structure-activity relationship 
      (QSAR)-guided modeling and docking-based comparative intermolecular contacts 
      analysis. The established pharmacophore models highlight structural features 
      needed for ligand recognition and revealed important binding-pocket regions 
      involved in 3CL(pro) -ligand interactions. The best models were used as 3D 
      queries to screen the National Cancer Institute database for novel 
      nonpeptidomimetic 3CL(pro) inhibitors. The identified hits were tested for 
      HKU4-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition. Two hits, which share the 
      phenylsulfonamide fragment, showed moderate inhibitory activity against the 
      MERS-CoV 3CL(pro) and represent a potential starting point for the development of 
      novel anti-MERS agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      pharmacophore modeling study supported by in vitro validation on the MERS-CoV 
      3CL(pro) . HIGHLIGHTS: MERS-CoV is an emerging virus that is closely related to 
      the bat HKU4-CoV. 3CL(pro) is a potential drug target for coronavirus infection. 
      HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) is a useful surrogate model for the identification of MERS-CoV 
      3CL(pro) enzyme inhibitors. dbCICA is a very robust modeling method for hit 
      identification. The phenylsulfonamide scaffold represents a potential starting 
      point for MERS coronavirus 3CL(pro) inhibitors development.

AB  - Although canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is an important respiratory 
      pathogen that is prevalent in many countries, only one complete genome sequence 
      of CRCoV (South Korea strain K37) has been obtained to date. Genome-wide analyses 
      and recombination have rarely been conducted, as small numbers of samples and 
      limited genomic characterization have previously prevented further analyses. 
      Herein, we report a unique CRCoV strain, denoted strain BJ232, derived from a 
      CRCoV-positive dog with a mild respiratory infection. Phylogenetic analysis based 
      on complete genome of all available coronaviruses consistently show that CRCoV 
      BJ232 is most closely related to human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and BCoV, 
      forming a separate clade that split off early from other Betacoronavirus 1. Based 
      on the phylogenetic and SimPlot analysis we propose that CRCoV-K37 was derived 
      from genetic recombination between CRCoV-BJ232 and BCoV. In detail, spike (S) 
      gene of CRCoV-K37 clustered with CRCoV-BJ232. However orf1ab, membrane (M) and 
      nucleocapsid (N) genes were more related to Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) than 
      CRCoV-B232. Molecular epidemic analysis confirmed the prevalence of CRCoV-BJ232 
      lineage around the world for a long time. Recombinant events among 
      Betacoronavirus 1 may have implications for CRCoV transmissibility. All these 
      findings provide further information regarding the origin of CRCoV.

AB  - Recently, we developed a monoclonal antibody-based rapid nucleocapsid protein 
      detection assay for diagnosis of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans and 
      dromedary camels. In this study, we examined the usefulness of this assay to 
      detect other lineage C betacoronaviruses closely related to MERS-CoV in bats. The 
      rapid MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein detection assay was tested positive in 24 
      (88.9%) of 27 Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV-HKU4) RNA-positive alimentary 
      samples of Tylonycteris pachypus and 4 (19.0%) of 21 Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 
      (Pi-BatCoV-HKU5) RNA-positive alimentary samples of Pipistrellus abramus. There 
      was significantly more Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 RNA-positive alimentary samples than 
      Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 RNA-positive alimentary samples that were tested positive by the 
      rapid MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein detection assay (P < 0.001 by Chi-square 
      test). The rapid assay was tested negative in all 51 alimentary samples 
      RNA-positive for alphacoronaviruses (Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU2, Myotis bat CoV 
      HKU6, Miniopterus bat CoV HKU8 and Hipposideros batCoV HKU10) and 32 alimentary 
      samples positive for lineage B (SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3) and 
      lineage D (Rousettus bat CoV HKU9) betacoronaviruses. No significant difference 
      was observed between the viral loads of Ty-BatCoV-HKU4/Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 
      RNA-positive alimentary samples that were tested positive and negative by the 
      rapid test (Mann-Witney U test). The rapid MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein 
      detection assay is able to rapidly detect lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats. It 
      detected significantly more Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 than Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 because MERS-CoV 
      is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 than Pi-BatCoV-HKU5. This assay will 
      facilitate rapid on-site mass screening of animal samples for ancestors of 
      MERS-CoV and tracking transmission in the related bat species.

AB  - The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
      highlights the zoonotic potential of Betacoronaviruses. Investigations into the 
      origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. 
      Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In 
      vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat 
      (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV 
      replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no 
      restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the 
      intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with 
      MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed 
      clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and 
      intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the 
      respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; 
      with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of 
      the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of 
      expression. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate 
      in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of 
      bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.

AB  - Coronavirus spike proteins mediate host-cell-attachment and virus entry. Virus 
      replication takes place within the host cell cytosol, whereas assembly and 
      budding occur at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. In 
      this study we demonstrated that the last 39 amino acid stretches of 
      Alphacoronavirus spike cytoplasmic domains of the human coronavirus 229E, NL63, 
      and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV interact with tubulin 
      alpha and beta chains. In addition, a partial co-localization of TGEV spike 
      proteins with authentic host cell β-tubulin was observed. Furthermore, 
      drug-induced microtubule depolymerization led to changes in spike protein 
      distribution, a reduction in the release of infectious virus particles and less 
      amount of spike protein incorporated into virions. These data demonstrate that 
      interaction of Alphacoronavirus spike proteins with tubulin supports S protein 
      transport and incorporation into virus particles.

AB  - Swine enteric coronavirus (CoV) is an important group of pathogens causing 
      diarrhea in piglets. At least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been 
      identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine 
      epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and the 
      emerging HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). The small intestines, 
      particularly the jejunum and ileum, are the most common targets of these four 
      CoVs in vivo, and co-infections by these CoVs are frequently observed in 
      clinically infected pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the 
      susceptibility of the porcine ileum epithelial cell line, IPI-2I, to different 
      swine enteric CoVs. We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, 
      PDCoV, and PEAV, as demonstrated by cytopathic effect and virus multiplication. 
      However, only a small number of cells could be infected by PEDV, possibly due to 
      the heterogeneity of IPI-2I cells. A homogeneous cell line, designated IPI-FX, 
      obtained from IPI-2I cells by sub-cloning with limited serial dilutions, was 
      found to be highly susceptible to PEDV. Furthermore, IPI-FX cells were also 
      highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, as well as PEAV. Thus, this sub-cloned IPI-FX 
      cell line is an ideal cell model to study the mechanisms of infection, 
      particularly co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) has significantly damaged America's 
      pork industry. Here we investigate the receptor usage and cell entry of PEDV. 
      PEDV recognizes protein receptor aminopeptidase N from pig and human and sugar 
      coreceptor N-acetylneuraminic acid. Moreover, PEDV infects cells from pig, human, 
      monkey, and bat. These results support the idea of bats as an evolutionary origin 
      for PEDV, implicate PEDV as a potential threat to other species, and suggest 
      antiviral strategies to control its spread.

AB  - Previous findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV)-related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 
      spike protein to utilize MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, 
      suggest a bat ancestral origin of MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell 
      lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus 
      abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, 
      Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5, and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their 
      susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 
      Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, 
      were susceptible to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV 
      strains showed different infectivities, with only two strains capable of 
      infecting three and one cell lines respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in 
      R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot replicate in any bat cells. Bat 
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to those of human 
      and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 
      residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. 
      DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with 
      significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells 
      (P = 0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection 
      in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV 
      susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in 
      determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should 
      prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its 
      ancestral origin.

TI  - Putative Receptor Binding Domain of Bat-Derived Coronavirus HKU9 Spike Protein: 
      Evolution of Betacoronavirus Receptor Binding Motifs.
PG  - 5977-5988
AB  - The suggested bat origin for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV) has revitalized the studies of other bat-derived coronaviruses with 
      respect to interspecies transmission potential. Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) HKU9 is 
      an important betacoronavirus (betaCoV) that is phylogenetically affiliated with 
      the same genus as MERS-CoV. The bat surveillance data indicated that BatCoV HKU9 
      has been widely spreading and circulating in bats. This highlights the necessity 
      of characterizing the virus for its potential to cross species barriers. The 
      receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike (S) protein recognizes 
      host receptors to mediate virus entry and is therefore a key factor determining 
      the viral tropism and transmission capacity. In this study, the putative S RBD of 
      BatCoV HKU9 (HKU9-RBD), which is homologous to other betaCoV RBDs that have been 
      structurally and functionally defined, was characterized via a series of 
      biophysical and crystallographic methods. By using surface plasmon resonance, we 
      demonstrated that HKU9-RBD binds to neither SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 nor MERS-CoV 
      receptor CD26. We further determined the atomic structure of HKU9-RBD, which as 
      expected is composed of a core and an external subdomain. The core subdomain fold 
      resembles those of other betaCoV RBDs, whereas the external subdomain is 
      structurally unique with a single helix, explaining the inability of HKU9-RBD to 
      react with either ACE2 or CD26. Via comparison of the available RBD structures, 
      we further proposed a homologous intersubdomain binding mode in betaCoV RBDs that 
      anchors the external subdomain to the core subdomain. The revealed RBD features 
      would shed light on the evolution route of betaCoV.

AB  - With more than 1 200 species, bats and flying foxes (Order Chiroptera) constitute 
      the most important and diverse order of Mammals after Rodents. Many species of 
      bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are 
      hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular 
      or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are 
      colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are 
      relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial 
      biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and 
      lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have 
      been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the 
      natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus 
      and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses 
      (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 
      (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are 
      considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly 
      responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly 
      pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and 
      domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal 
      public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different 
      phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that 
      most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a 
      long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. 
      The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus 
      between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better 
      understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, 
      epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are 
      not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet, the population 
      size and the particular densities observed in species with crowded roosting 
      behavior, the population structure and migrations, the hibernation permitting 
      overwintering of viruses, their particular innate and acquired immune response, 
      probably related at least partially to their ability to fly, allowing persistent 
      virus infections and preventing immunopathological consequences, etc. It is also 
      necessary to get a better knowledge of the interactions between bats and ecologic 
      changes induced by man and to attentively follow bat populations and their 
      viruses through surveillance networks involving human and veterinary physicians, 
      specialists of wild fauna, ecologists, etc. in order to understand the mechanisms 
      of disease emergence, to try to foresee and, perhaps, to prevent viral emergences 
      beforehand. Finally, a more fundamental research about immune mechanisms 
      developed in viral infections is essential to reveal the reasons why Chiroptera 
      are so efficient reservoir hosts. Clearly, a great deal of additional work is 
      needed to document the roles of bats in the natural history of viruses.

AB  - The outbreak of the SARS coronavirus in 2002/2003 and the recent disease cases 
      with a new human coronavirus (originally designated EMC-CoV, recently renamed 
      MERS-CoV) have put the focus onto the virus family Coronaviridae. Both viruses 
      appeared to have managed to jump over the species barrier from a bat reservoir to 
      the human population. Bats are considered to serve as a natural reservoir for 
      coronaviruses infecting mammals. An important factor for crossing the 
      species-barrier is the adaptation to a new receptor on cells of the new host 
      species. During evolution coronaviruses have developed a large diversity of 
      binding specificities demonstrating the high flexibility of the coronaviral spike 
      protein, which is responsible for binding to target cells.

TI  - Porcine Deltacoronavirus Engages the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus 
      Functional Receptor Porcine Aminopeptidase N for Infectious Cellular Entry.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00318-18 [doi]
LID - e00318-18
AB  - Identification of cellular receptors used by coronavirus (CoV) entry into the 
      host cells is critical to an understanding of pathogenesis and to development of 
      intervention strategies. The fourth CoV genus, Deltacoronavirus, evolutionarily 
      related to the Gammacoronavirus, has just been defined recently. In the current 
      study, we demonstrate that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) acts as a cross-genus 
      CoV functional receptor for both enteropathogenic porcine deltacoronovirus 
      (PDCoV) and alphacoronovirus (AlphaCoV) (transmissible gastroenteritis virus 
      [TGEV]) based upon three lines of evidence. First, the soluble S1 protein of 
      PDCoV bound to the surface of target porcine cell lines known to express pAPN as 
      efficiently as TGEV-S1, which could be blocked by soluble pAPN pretreatment. 
      Second, both PDCoV-S1 and TGEV-S1 physically recognized and interacted with pAPN 
      by coimmunoprecipitation in pAPN cDNA-transfected cells and by dot blot 
      hybridization assay. Finally, exogenous expression of pAPN in refractory cells 
      conferred susceptibility to PDCoV-S1 binding and to PDCoV entry and productive 
      infection. PDCoV-S1 appeared to have a lower pAPN-binding affinity and likely 
      consequent lower infection efficiency in pAPN-expressing refractory cells than 
      TGEV-S1, suggesting that there may be differences between these two viruses in 
      the virus-binding regions in pAPN. This study paves the way for dissecting the 
      molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis as well as 
      facilitates future vaccine development and intervention strategies against PDCoV 
      infection.IMPORTANCE The emergence of new human and animal coronaviruses is 
      believed to have occurred through interspecies transmission that is mainly 
      mediated by a species-specific receptor of the host. Among the four genera of the 
      Coronavirinae, a couple of functional receptors for the representative members in 
      the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus have been identified, whereas 
      receptors for Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, which are believed to 
      originate from birds, are still unknown. Porcine coronaviruses, including the 
      newly discovered porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) associated with diarrhea in 
      newborn piglets, have posed a serious threat to the pork industry in Asia and 
      North America. Here, we report that PDCoV employs the alphacoronavirus TGEV 
      functional receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) for cellular entry, 
      demonstrating the usage of pAPN as a cross-genus CoV functional receptor. The 
      identification of the PDCoV receptor provides another example of the expanded 
      host range of CoV and paves the way for further investigation of PDCoV-host 
      interaction and pathogenesis.

AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) invades the central 
      nervous system (CNS) and causes neurodegenerative disease in suckling piglets, 
      but the understanding of its neuropathogenicity for neurological dysfunction 
      remains limited. Here, we report that miR-142-5p is localized to neurons and 
      negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis in porcine hemagglutinating 
      encephalomyelitis (PHE). This phenotype was mediated by miR-142-5p inhibition of 
      an mRNA encoding unc-51-like-kinase1 (Ulk1), which controls axon outgrowth and 
      dendrite formation. Modulating miR-142-5p activity by microRNA mimics or 
      inhibitors induced neurodegeneration, including stunted axon elongation, unstable 
      dendritic spine formation, and irregular swelling and disconnection in neurites. 
      Relieving Ulk1 mRNA repression in primary cortical neurons by miR-142-5p 
      antagomirs or replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding Ulk1 (Ad5-Ulk1), which 
      improved rescue of nerve injury, restricted viral replication, and increased 
      survival rate in mice underlying PHEV infection. In contrast, disrupting Ulk1 in 
      RNAi-expressing neurons mostly led to significantly shortened axon elongation 
      and/or an abnormally large number of branched dendrites. Taken together, we 
      demonstrated that the abnormal neuronal morphogenesis underlying PHEV infection 
      was mainly caused by functional mRNA repression of the miR-142-5p target Ulk1. 
      Our data revealed that PHEV adapted to use spatiotemporal control of host 
      microRNAs to invade CNS, and provided new insights into the virus-associated 
      neurological dysfunction microenvironment.

TI  - Evidence for an Ancestral Association of Human Coronavirus 229E with Bats.
PG  - 11858-70
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01755-15 [doi]
AB  - We previously showed that close relatives of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) 
      exist in African bats. The small sample and limited genomic characterizations 
      have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens 
      from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse 
      transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare 
      the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates 
      and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 
      6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
      and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic 
      and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in 
      close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related 
      alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human 
      viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a 
      single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E 
      and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to 
      all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs 
      revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3' end. ORF8 
      also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences 
      showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this 
      ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These 
      data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, 
      hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of 
      HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE: The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 
      likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an 
      evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by 
      analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses 
      on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human 
      viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form 
      a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the 
      formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including 
      deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. 
      We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss 
      the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human 
      viruses. The evolutionary history of HCoV-229E likely shares important 
      characteristics with that of the recently emerged highly pathogenic Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.

AB  - Infection with coronavirus rearranges the host cell membrane to assemble a 
      replication/transcription complex in which replication of the viral genome and 
      transcription of viral mRNA occur. Although coexistence of nsp3 and nsp4 is known 
      to cause membrane rearrangement, the mechanisms underlying the interaction of 
      these two proteins remain unclear. We demonstrated that binding of nsp4 with nsp3 
      is essential for membrane rearrangement and identified amino acid residues in 
      nsp4 responsible for the interaction with nsp3. In addition, we revealed that the 
      nsp3-nsp4 interaction is not sufficient to induce membrane rearrangement, 
      suggesting the participation of other factors such as host proteins. Finally, we 
      showed that loss of the nsp3-nsp4 interaction eliminated viral replication by 
      using an infectious cDNA clone and replicon system of SARS-CoV. These findings 
      provide clues to the mechanism of the replication/transcription complex assembly 
      of SARS-CoV and could reveal an antiviral target for the treatment of 
      betacoronavirus infection.

AB  - Coronaviruses are responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract infections in 
      humans. It is estimated that 1 to 10% of the population suffers annually from 
      cold-like symptoms related to infection with human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), 
      an alphacoronavirus. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural component 
      of the capsid, facilitates RNA packing, links the capsid to the envelope, and is 
      also involved in multiple other processes, including viral replication and 
      evasion of the immune system. Although the role of N protein in viral replication 
      is relatively well described, no structural data are currently available 
      regarding the N proteins of alphacoronaviruses. Moreover, our understanding of 
      the mechanisms of RNA binding and nucleocapsid formation remains incomplete. In 
      this study, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains 
      (NTD, residues 10 to 140, and CTD, residues 221 to 340, respectively) of the N 
      protein of HCoV-NL63, both at a 1.5-Å resolution. Based on our structure of NTD 
      solved here, we proposed and experimentally evaluated a model of RNA binding. The 
      structure of the CTD reveals the mode of N protein dimerization. Overall, this 
      study expands our understanding of the initial steps of N protein-nucleic acid 
      interaction and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated 
      infections.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold and other 
      respiratory tract infections in humans. According to multiple studies, 1 to 10% 
      of the population is infected each year with HCoV-NL63. Viruses are relatively 
      simple organisms composed of a few proteins and the nucleic acids that carry the 
      information determining their composition. The nucleocapsid (N) protein studied 
      in this work protects the nucleic acid from the environmental factors during 
      virus transmission. This study investigated the structural arrangement of N 
      protein, explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the 
      initial stages of virus structure assembly. The results expand our understanding 
      of coronavirus physiology and may facilitate future efforts to control the 
      associated infections.

TI  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus NS4b Protein Inhibits Host RNase L 
      Activation.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the first highly 
      pathogenic human coronavirus to emerge since severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002. Like many coronaviruses, MERS-CoV carries genes 
      that encode multiple accessory proteins that are not required for replication of 
      the genome but are likely involved in pathogenesis. Evasion of host innate 
      immunity through interferon (IFN) antagonism is a critical component of viral 
      pathogenesis. The IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway 
      activates upon sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activated RNase L 
      cleaves viral and host single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which leads to translational 
      arrest and subsequent cell death, preventing viral replication and spread. Here 
      we report that MERS-CoV, a lineage CBetacoronavirus, and related bat CoV NS4b 
      accessory proteins have phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and antagonize OAS-RNase 
      L by enzymatically degrading 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A), activators of RNase L. 
      This is a novel function for NS4b, which has previously been reported to 
      antagonize IFN signaling. NS4b proteins are distinct from lineage 
      ABetacoronavirusPDEs and rotavirus gene-encoded PDEs, in having an amino-terminal 
      nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are localized mostly to the nucleus. 
      However, the expression level of cytoplasmic MERS-CoV NS4b protein is sufficient 
      to prevent activation of RNase L. Finally, this is the first report of an RNase L 
      antagonist expressed by a human or bat coronavirus and provides a specific 
      mechanism by which this occurs. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for 
      evasion of innate immunity by MERS-CoV while also identifying a potential target 
      for therapeutic intervention. IMPORTANCE: Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the first highly pathogenic human coronavirus to emerge 
      since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). MERS-CoV, like 
      other coronaviruses, carries genes that encode accessory proteins that antagonize 
      the host antiviral response, often the type I interferon response, and contribute 
      to virulence. We found that MERS-CoV NS4b and homologs from related lineage C bat 
      betacoronaviruses BtCoV-SC2013 (SC2013) and BtCoV-HKU5 (HKU5) are members of the 
      2H-phosphoesterase (2H-PE) enzyme family with phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. 
      Like murine coronavirus NS2, a previously characterized PDE, MERS NS4b, can 
      antagonize activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway, an interferon-induced potent 
      antiviral activity. Furthermore, MERS-CoV mutants with deletion of genes encoding 
      accessory proteins NS3 to NS5 or NS4b alone or inactivation of the PDE can 
      activate RNase L during infection of Calu-3 cells. Our report may offer a 
      potential target for therapeutic intervention if NS4b proves to be critical to 
      pathogenesis inin vivomodels of MERS-CoV infection.

TI  - Diversity of coronavirus in bats from Eastern Thailand.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s12985-015-0289-1 [doi]
LID - 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses (CoVs), 
      including those closely related to human pathogens such as Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV. There 
      are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are 
      endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance 
      efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. FINDINGS: A 
      total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 
      provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal 
      swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed 
      directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and 
      preserved at -80°C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens 
      (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR 
      primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all 
      CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one 
      lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV 
      reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous 
      melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and 
      Megaderma lyra. CONCLUSIONS: CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in 
      different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data 
      suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our 
      phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats 
      sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand. Further 
      characterization of additional CoV genes may be useful to better describe the CoV 
      divergence.

TI  - The re-emerging of SADS-CoV infection in pig herds in Southern China.
PG  - 2180-2183
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13270 [doi]
AB  - A new highly virulent swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 
      emerged in Guangdong province in 2017 followed by fatal diarrhoea that involved 
      the death of 24,693 piglets. And yet from May 2017 to January 2019, there were no 
      new SADS cases arising in pig herds in Guangdong. In this study, we reported the 
      recent diarrhoea outbreak of SADS-CoV in Southern China on February 2019. 
      Intestinal samples collected from diarrhoeal piglets were detected for common 
      swine virus and confirmed that SADS-CoV was responsible for the diarrhoea case. 
      Meanwhile, serological investigation of sows' sera implied that SADS-CoV has 
      existed in the farm and PEDV antibody may not directly contribute to the 
      amplification of SADS-CoV. Homology and phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome 
      showed that the re-emerging SADS-CoV strain shared high sequence identities with 
      existing SADS-CoV strains and all strains clustered together in Alpha 
      coronavirus. All in all, the report herein emphasized the re-emerging of SADS-CoV 
      and highlights continuous monitoring for this virus.

AB  - Bats have been widely known as natural reservoir hosts of zoonotic diseases, such 
      as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      (MERS) caused by coronaviruses (CoVs). In the present study, we investigated the 
      whole genomic sequence of a SARS-like bat CoV (16BO133) and found it to be 
      29,075 nt in length with a 40.9% G+C content. Phylogenetic analysis using amino 
      acid sequences of the ORF 1ab and the spike gene showed that the bat coronavirus 
      strain 16BO133 was grouped with the Beta-CoV lineage B and was closely related to 
      the JTMC15 strain isolated from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in China. However, 
      16BO133 was distinctly located in the phylogenetic topology of the human SARS CoV 
      strain (Tor2). Interestingly, 16BO133 showed complete elimination of ORF8 regions 
      induced by a frame shift of the stop codon in ORF7b. The lowest amino acid 
      identity of 16BO133 was identified at the spike region among various ORFs. The 
      spike region of 16BO133 showed 84.7% and 75.2% amino acid identity with Rf1 
      (SARS-like bat CoV) and Tor2 (human SARS CoV), respectively. In addition, the S 
      gene of 16BO133 was found to contain the amino acid substitution of two critical 
      residues (N479S and T487 V) associated with human infection. In conclusion, we 
      firstly carried out whole genome characterization of the SARS-like bat 
      coronavirus discovered in the Republic of Korea; however, it presumably has no 
      human infectivity. However, continuous surveillance and genomic characterization 
      of coronaviruses from bats are necessary due to potential risks of human 
      infection induced by genetic mutation.

TI  - Surveillance of Bat Coronaviruses in Kenya Identifies Relatives of Human

AB  - Bats harbor a large diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), several of which are 
      related to zoonotic pathogens that cause severe disease in humans. Our screening 
      of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from 
      several novel CoVs but, more significantly, identified sequences that were 
      closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human 
      viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a 
      recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like 
      viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5' and 
      3' ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies 
      recombination events involving the S gene were identified, suggesting that this 
      region may represent a recombination "hot spot" in CoV genomes. Finally, using a 
      combination of phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, we showed that the 
      genetic diversity of bat CoVs is primarily structured by host species and 
      subsequently by geographic distances.IMPORTANCE Understanding the driving forces 
      of cross-species virus transmission is central to understanding the nature of 
      disease emergence. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats are the ultimate 
      reservoir hosts for a number of coronaviruses (CoVs), including ancestors of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E). However, the 
      evolutionary pathways of bat CoVs remain elusive. We provide evidence for natural 
      recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses associated with 
      Triaenops afer and Hipposideros sp. bats that resulted in a NL63-like virus, an 
      ancestor of the human pathogen HCoV-NL63. These results suggest that interspecies 
      recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of 
      novel CoVs with zoonotic potential.

AB  - South-East Asia is a hot spot for emerging zoonotic diseases, and bats have been 
      recognized as hosts for a large number of zoonotic viruses such as Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), responsible for acute respiratory syndrome 
      outbreaks. Thus, it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of 
      viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have 
      been reported in bat species from Thailand, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and the 
      Philippines. However no such work was conducted in Cambodia or Lao PDR. Between 
      2010 and 2013, 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human 
      populations in these two countries. They were tested for the presence of 
      coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-PCR assay. A total of 93 samples 
      (4.7%) from 17 genera of bats tested positive. Sequence analysis revealed the 
      presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus 
      (αCoV) and beta-CoV (βCoV), respectively. The βCoVs group is known to include 
      some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All 
      coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats (family Pteropodidae) 
      (n=55) clustered with other bat βCoVs of lineage D, whereas one coronavirus from 
      Pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage C of βCoVs which also includes the 
      MERS-CoV. αCoVs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and 
      clustered with diverse bat αCoV sequences previously published. A closely related 
      strain of PEDV, responsible for severe diarrhea in pigs (PEDV-CoV), was detected 
      in 2 Myotis bats. We highlighted the presence and the high diversity of 
      coronaviruses circulating in bats from Cambodia and Lao PDR. Three new bat genera 
      and species were newly identified as host of coronaviruses, namely Macroglossus 
      sp., Megaerops niphanae and Myotis horsfieldii.

TI  - Targeting zoonotic viruses: Structure-based inhibition of the 3C-like protease 
      from bat coronavirus HKU4--The likely reservoir host to the human coronavirus 
      that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
PG  - 6036-48

AB  - The bat coronavirus HKU4 belongs to the same 2c lineage as that of the deadly 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and shows high sequence 
      similarity, therefore potentiating a threat to the human population through a 
      zoonotic shift or 'spill over' event. To date, there are no effective vaccines or 
      antiviral treatments available that are capable of limiting the pathogenesis of 
      any human coronaviral infection. An attractive target for the development of 
      anti-coronaviral therapeutics is the 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which is 
      essential for the progression of the coronaviral life cycle. Herein, we report 
      the screening results of a small, 230-member peptidomimetic library against 
      HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) and the identification of 43 peptidomimetic compounds showing 
      good to excellent inhibitory potency of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) with IC50 values 
      ranging from low micromolar to sub-micromolar. We established structure-activity 
      relationships (SARs) describing the important ligand-based features required for 
      potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition and identified a seemingly favored peptidic 
      backbone for HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition. To investigate this, a molecular 
      sub-structural analysis of the most potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitor was 
      accomplished by the synthesis and testing of the lead peptidomimetic inhibitor's 
      sub-structural components, confirming the activity of the favored backbone (22A) 
      identified via SAR analysis. In order to elucidate the structural reasons for 
      such potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition by the peptidomimetics having the 22A 
      backbone, we determined the X-ray structures of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) in complex with 
      three peptidomimetic inhibitors. Sequence alignment of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro), and two 
      other lineage C Betacoronaviruses 3CL(pro)'s, HKU5-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro), 
      show that the active site residues of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) that participate in 
      inhibitor binding are conserved in HKU5-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro). Furthermore, 
      we assayed our most potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitor for inhibition of HKU5-CoV 
      3CL(pro) and found it to have sub-micromolar inhibitory activity 
      (IC50=0.54±0.03μM). The X-ray structures and SAR analysis reveal critical 
      insights into the structure and inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro), providing 
      fundamental knowledge that may be exploited in the development of 
      anti-coronaviral therapeutics for coronaviruses emerging from zoonotic 
      reservoirs.

AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a member of the genus 
      betacoronavirus within the family coronaviridae, which invades the central 
      nervous system (CNS) via peripheral nervous system and causes encephalomyelitis 
      or vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) in sucking piglets. Up to now, although few 
      complete nucleotide sequences of PHEV have been reported, they are not annotated. 
      This study aimed to illuminate genome characterization, phylogenesis and 
      pathogenicity of the PHEV/2008 strain. The full length of the PHEV/2008 strain 
      genome was 30,684 bp, with a G + C content of 37.27%. The genome included at a 
      minimum of 11 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5' and 3' 
      untranslated regions (UTR) of 211 and 289 nucleotides. The replicase polyproteins 
      pp1a and pp1ab, which had 4382 and 7094 amino acid residues, respectively, were 
      predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases. Phylogenetic 
      analysis based on the complete genome sequence revealed that PHEV/2008 strain was 
      genetically different from other known PHEV types, which represented a novel 
      genotype (GI-1). In addition, we found that PHEV/2008 was neurotropic and highly 
      pathogenic to 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Taken together, this is the first detailed 
      annotated, complete genomic sequence of a new genotype PHEV strain in China.

AB  - We report the isolation and characterization of a novel bat coronavirus which is 
      much closer to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 
      genomic sequence than others previously reported, particularly in its S gene. 
      Cell entry and susceptibility studies indicated that this virus can use ACE2 as a 
      receptor and infect animal and human cell lines. Our results provide further 
      evidence of the bat origin of the SARS-CoV and highlight the likelihood of future 
      bat coronavirus emergence in humans.

TI  - Longitudinal study of age-specific pattern of coronavirus infection in Lyle's 
      flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Thailand.
PG  - 38

LID - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel 
      viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) (mainly Alphacoronavirus and 
      Betacoronavirus). Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei)'s roosts and foraging sites 
      are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific 
      pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts 
      and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control 
      CoV outbreak. METHODS: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during 
      January-December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; 
      two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open 
      pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV 
      detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic 
      analysis. RESULTS: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats 
      between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). 
      Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured 
      at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) 
      (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV 
      infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 
      (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The 
      average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No 
      gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic 
      analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group 
      D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The fact 
      that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may 
      suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral 
      reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining 
      transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.

AB  - Viruses in the family Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales, are etiologic 
      agents of a range of human and animal diseases, including both mild and severe 
      respiratory diseases in humans. These viruses encode conserved replicase and 
      structural proteins as well as more diverse accessory proteins, encoded in the 3' 
      ends of their genomes, that often act as host cell antagonists. We previously 
      showed that 2',5'-phosphodiesterases (2',5'-PDEs) encoded by the prototypical 
      Betacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and by Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome-associated coronavirus antagonize the oligoadenylate-RNase L (OAS-RNase 
      L) pathway. Here we report that additional coronavirus superfamily members, 
      including lineage A betacoronaviruses and toroviruses infecting both humans and 
      animals, encode 2',5'-PDEs capable of antagonizing RNase L. We used a chimeric 
      MHV system (MHV(Mut)) in which exogenous PDEs were expressed from an MHV backbone 
      lacking the gene for a functional NS2 protein, the endogenous RNase L antagonist. 
      With this system, we found that 2',5'-PDEs encoded by the human coronavirus 
      HCoV-OC43 (OC43; an agent of the common cold), human enteric coronavirus (HECoV), 
      equine coronavirus (ECoV), and equine torovirus Berne (BEV) are enzymatically 
      active, rescue replication of MHV(Mut) in bone marrow-derived macrophages, and 
      inhibit RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation in these cells. Additionally, PDEs 
      encoded by OC43 and BEV rescue MHV(Mut) replication and restore pathogenesis in 
      wild-type (WT) B6 mice. This finding expands the range of viruses known to encode 
      antagonists of the potent OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway, highlighting its 
      importance in a range of species as well as the selective pressures exerted on 
      viruses to antagonize it.IMPORTANCE Viruses in the family Coronaviridae include 
      important human and animal pathogens, including the recently emerged viruses 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We showed previously 
      that two viruses within the genus Betacoronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 
      and MERS-CoV, encode 2',5'-phosphodiesterases (2',5'-PDEs) that antagonize the 
      OAS-RNase L pathway, and we report here that these proteins are furthermore 
      conserved among additional coronavirus superfamily members, including lineage A 
      betacoronaviruses and toroviruses, suggesting that they may play critical roles 
      in pathogenesis. As there are no licensed vaccines or effective antivirals 
      against human coronaviruses and few against those infecting animals, identifying 
      viral proteins contributing to virulence can inform therapeutic development. 
      Thus, this work demonstrates that a potent antagonist of host antiviral defenses 
      is encoded by multiple and diverse viruses within the family Coronaviridae, 
      presenting a possible broad-spectrum therapeutic target.

TI  - Induction of Atypical Autophagy by Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis 
      Virus Contributes to Viral Replication.

LID - 56
AB  - Autophagy is a basic biological metabolic process involving in intracellular 
      membrane transport pathways that recycle cellular components and eliminate 
      intracellular microorganisms within the lysosome. Autophagy also plays an 
      important part in virus infection and propagation. However, some pathogens, 
      including viruses, have evolved unique trick to escape or exploit autophagy. This 
      study explores the mechanism of autophagy induction by porcine hemagglutinating 
      encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in Neuro-2a cells, and examines the role of 
      autophagy in PHEV replication. PHEV triggered autophagy in Neuro-2a cells is 
      dependent on the presence of bulk double- or single-membrane vacuoles, the 
      accumulation of GFP-LC3 fluorescent dots, and the LC3 lipidation. In addition, 
      PHEV induced an incomplete autophagic effect because the degradation level of p62 
      did not change in PHEV-infected cells. Further validation was captured using 
      LysoTracker and lysosome-associated membrane protein by indirect 
      immunofluorescence labeling in PHEV-infected cells. We also investigated the 
      change in viral replication by pharmacological experiments with the autophagy 
      inducer rapamycin or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, and the lysosomal inhibitor 
      chloroquine (CQ). Suppression of autophagy by 3-MA increased viral replication, 
      compared with the mock treatment, while promoting of autophagy by rapamycin 
      reduced PHEV replication. CQ treatment enhanced the LC3 lipidation in 
      PHEV-infected Neuro-2a cells but lowered PHEV replication. These results show 
      that PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy and causes the appearance of 
      autophagosomes but blocks the fusion with lysosomes, which is necessary for the 
      replication of PHEV in nerve cells.

TI  - Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of new bat astroviruses detected in 
      Gabon, Central Africa.
PG  - 386-392
AB  - Astroviruses are emerging RNA viruses that cause enteropathogenic infections in 
      humans and in other mammals. The identification of astroviruses in a wide range 
      of animals highlights the zoonotic importance of these viruses. Bats can harbor 
      many different viruses, among which some are highly pathogenic for humans (for 
      instance, Nipah, Ebola and SARS coronavirus), and also several astroviruses. As 
      some RNA viruses can be directly transmitted from bats to humans, it is crucial 
      to collect data about their frequency, genetic diversity and phylogenetic 
      characterization. In this study, we report the molecular identification of 44 new 
      astroviruses (with a detection rate of 4.5%) in 962 apparently healthy bats that 
      belong to five different species and that were captured in different caves in 
      North-East Gabon, Central Africa. Our results show that bat astroviruses form a 
      group that is genetically distinct from astroviruses infecting other mammals. 
      Moreover, these astroviruses showed an important genetic diversity and low host 
      restriction in bat species.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of Dromedary Camel Coronavirus UAE-HKU23 from 
      Dromedaries of the Middle East: Minimal Serological Cross-Reactivity between MERS 
      Coronavirus and Dromedary Camel Coronavirus UAE-HKU23.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17050691 [doi]
LID - 691
AB  - Recently, we reported the discovery of a dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 
      (DcCoV UAE-HKU23) from dromedaries in the Middle East. In this study, DcCoV 
      UAE-HKU23 was successfully isolated in two of the 14 dromedary fecal samples 
      using HRT-18G cells, with cytopathic effects observed five days after 
      inoculation. Northern blot analysis revealed at least seven distinct RNA species, 
      corresponding to predicted subgenomic mRNAs and confirming the core sequence of 
      transcription regulatory sequence motifs as 5'-UCUAAAC-3' as we predicted 
      previously. Antibodies against DcCoV UAE-HKU23 were detected in 58 (98.3%) and 59 
      (100%) of the 59 dromedary sera by immunofluorescence and neutralization antibody 
      tests, respectively. There was significant correlation between the antibody 
      titers determined by immunofluorescence and neutralization assays (Pearson 
      coefficient = 0.525, p < 0.0001). Immunization of mice using recombinant N 
      proteins of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV), respectively, and heat-inactivated DcCoV UAE-HKU23 showed minimal 
      cross-antigenicity between DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and MERS-CoV by Western blot and 
      neutralization antibody assays. Codon usage and genetic distance analysis of 
      RdRp, S and N genes showed that the 14 strains of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 formed a 
      distinct cluster, separated from those of other closely related members of 
      Betacoronavirus 1, including alpaca CoV, confirming that DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is a 
      novel member of Betacoronavirus 1.

PG  - 174-192
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2017.2191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first 
      identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to 
      synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We 
      identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these 
      based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical 
      characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and 
      transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. 
      RESULTS: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor 
      for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. 
      Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, 
      but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in 
      dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence 
      of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel 
      contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown. There have been 
      sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, 
      the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East. 
      Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include 
      environmental contamination. Various potential therapeutics have been identified, 
      but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate vaccine 
      has progressed to Phase I trials. CONCLUSIONS: There has been substantial 
      MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially 
      in epidemiology and natural history of the infection. There have been few 
      rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease. 
      Terms such as "camel exposure" and the epidemiological relationships of cases 
      should be clearly defined and standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and 
      accessible registry or database. Coronaviruses will likely continue to emerge, 
      arguing for a unified "One Health" approach.

TI  - Novel Alphacoronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses Cocirculate with Type 1 and Severe 
      Acute Respiratory System (SARS)-Related Betacoronaviruses in Synanthropic Bats of 
      Luxembourg.

AB  - Several infectious disease outbreaks with high mortality in humans have been 
      attributed to viruses that are thought to have evolved from bat viruses. In this 
      study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses 
      and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis 
      emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed 
      longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n 
      = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 
      2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 
      1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and 
      coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike 
      glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene 
      of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus 
      strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by 
      Rhinolophus ferrumequinum Logistic regression revealed that the level of 
      Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), 
      probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close 
      virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains 
      suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially 
      connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus1 
      strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with 
      mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and 
      Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species 
      barrier after a host adaptation process.IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir 
      of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a 
      Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that 
      were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate 
      animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with 
      suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European 
      bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of 
      bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other 
      European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national 
      surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in 
      disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic 
      bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species barrier.

TI  - Genetic relatedness of the novel human group C betacoronavirus to Tylonycteris 
      bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5.
PG  - e35
LID - 10.1038/emi.2012.45 [doi]
AB  - The recent outbreak of severe respiratory infections associated with a novel 
      group C betacoronavirus (HCoV-EMC) from Saudi Arabia has drawn global attention 
      to another highly probable "SARS-like" animal-to-human interspecies jumping event 
      in coronavirus (CoV). The genome of HCoV-EMC is most closely related to 
      Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat 
      coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) we discovered in 2006. Phylogenetically, 
      HCoV-EMC is clustered with Ty-BatCoV HKU4/Pi-BatCoV HKU5 with high bootstrap 
      supports, indicating that HCoV-EMC is a group C betaCoV. The major difference 
      between HCoV-EMC and Ty-BatCoV HKU4/Pi-BatCoV HKU5 is in the region between S and 
      E, where HCoV-EMC possesses five ORFs (NS3a-NS3e) instead of four, with low 
      (31%-62%) amino acid identities to Ty-BatCoV HKU4/Pi-BatCoV HKU5. Comparison of 
      the seven conserved replicase domains for species demarcation shows that HCoV-EMC 
      is a novel CoV species. More intensive surveillance studies in bats and other 
      animals may reveal the natural host of HCoV-EMC.

AB  - Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), identified in 2003, is a member of the 
      Coronaviridae family. The virus is a betacoronavirus and a close relative of 
      human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Here, we examined entry of CRCoV 
      into human rectal tumor cells (HRT-18G cell line) by analyzing co-localization of 
      single virus particles with cellular markers in the presence or absence of 
      chemical inhibitors of pathways potentially involved in virus entry. We also 
      targeted these pathways using siRNA. The results show that the virus hijacks 
      caveolin-dependent endocytosis to enter cells via endocytic internalization.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, 
      is a causative agent of porcine enteric disease characterized by acute watery 
      diarrhea and dehydration in sucking piglet. Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV 
      spike protein mediates its cell entry by binding to cellular receptors and 
      inducing membrane fusion between viral envelopes and cellular membranes. However, 
      the entry mechanism of PEDV is not studied. Here, we determined the entry 
      mechanism of PEDV into Vero cells. Our data confirmed that PEDV entry followed 
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis independence of caveolae-coated pit assembly. The 
      internalized PEDV was co-localized with the clathrin-mediated endocytic marker, 
      but not with the caveolae-mediated endocytic marker. In addition, cells treated 
      with lysosomotropic agents and serine protease inhibitors were resistant to PEDV. 
      Our data revealed that PEDV entry followed clathrin-mediated endocytosis and was 
      dependent on a low pH and serine proteolysis for successful entry into cells.

AB  - It is speculated that bats are important reservoir hosts for numerous viruses, 
      with 27 viral families reportedly detected in bats. Majority of these viruses 
      have not been isolated and there is little information regarding their biology in 
      bats. Establishing a well-characterized bat cell line supporting the replication 
      of bat-borne viruses would facilitate the analysis of virus-host interactions in 
      an in vitro model. Currently, few bat cell lines have been developed and only 
      Tb1-Lu, derived from Tadarida brasiliensis is commercially available. Here we 
      describe a method to establish and immortalize big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) 
      kidney (Efk3) cells using the Myotis polyomavirus T-antigen. Subclones of this 
      cell line expressed both epithelial and fibroblast markers to varying extents. 
      Cell clones expressed interferon beta in response to poly(I:C) stimulation and 
      supported the replication of four different viruses, namely, vesicular stomatitis 
      virus (VSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PED-CoV), Middle-East 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). To 
      our knowledge, this is the first bat cell line from a northern latitude 
      insectivorous bat developed using a novel technology. The cell line has the 
      potential to be used for isolation of bat viruses and for studying virus-bat 
      interactions in culture.

TI  - Detection of new genetic variants of Betacoronaviruses in Endemic Frugivorous 
      Bats of Madagascar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) 
      of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to 
      harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect 
      humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a 
      genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though 
      Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of 
      which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the 
      island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in 
      close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where 
      people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The 
      purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in 
      Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. METHODS: 
      Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different 
      regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence 
      of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, 
      which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were 
      performed from positive specimens. RESULTS: From 351 frugivorous bats, we 
      detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were 
      identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall 
      prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains 
      belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem 
      to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the 
      needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals 
      that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how 
      coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.

TI  - Human coronavirus NL63 utilizes heparan sulfate proteoglycans for attachment to 
      target cells.
PG  - 13221-30
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02078-14 [doi]
AB  - Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is an alphacoronavirus that was first 
      identified in 2004 in the nasopharyngeal aspirate from a 7-month-old patient with 
      a respiratory tract infection. Previous studies showed that HCoV-NL63 and the 
      genetically distant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV employ the same 
      receptor for host cell entry, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it is 
      largely unclear whether ACE2 interactions are sufficient to allow HCoV-NL63 
      binding to cells. The present study showed that directed expression of 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cells previously resistant to HCoV-NL63 
      renders them susceptible, showing that ACE2 protein acts as a functional receptor 
      and that its expression is required for infection. However, comparative analysis 
      showed that directed expression or selective scission of the ACE2 protein had no 
      measurable effect on virus adhesion. In contrast, binding of HCoV-NL63 to heparan 
      sulfates was required for viral attachment and infection of target cells, showing 
      that these molecules serve as attachment receptors for HCoV-NL63. IMPORTANCE: 
      ACE2 protein was proposed as a receptor for HCoV-NL63 already in 2005, but an 
      in-depth analysis of early events during virus infection had not been performed 
      thus far. Here, we show that the ACE2 protein is required for viral entry but 
      that it is not the primary binding site on the cell surface. Conducted research 
      showed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans function as adhesion molecules, 
      increasing the virus density on cell surface and possibly facilitating the 
      interaction between HCoV-NL63 and its receptor. Obtained results show that the 
      initial events during HCoV-NL63 infection are more complex than anticipated and 
      that a newly described interaction may be essential for understanding the 
      infection process and, possibly, also assist in drug design.

AB  - Previous studies indicated that fruit bats carry two betacoronaviruses, BatCoV 
      HKU9 and BatCoV GCCDC1. To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of 
      these coronaviruses, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in fruit bats in 
      Yunnan province, China during 2009-2016. A total of 59 (10.63%) bat samples were 
      positive for the two betacorona-viruses, 46 (8.29%) for HKU9 and 13 (2.34%) for 
      GCCDC1, or closely related viruses. We identified a novel HKU9 strain, 
      tentatively designated as BatCoV HKU9-2202, by sequencing the full-length genome. 
      The BatCoV HKU9-2202 shared 83% nucleotide identity with other BatCoV HKU9 stains 
      based on whole genome sequences. The most divergent region is in the spike 
      protein, which only shares 68% amino acid identity with BatCoV HKU9. Quantitative 
      PCR revealed that the intestine was the primary infection organ of BatCoV HKU9 
      and GCCDC1, but some HKU9 was also detected in the heart, kidney, and lung 
      tissues of bats. This study highlights the importance of virus surveillance in 
      natural reservoirs and emphasizes the need for preparedness against the potential 
      spill-over of these viruses to local residents living near bat caves.

      monitor the populations and characterize these viruses. In this study, the 
      presence of coronaviruses (CoVs) in different species of Danish bats was 
      investigated using active surveillance at different geographical locations in 
      Denmark. Faecal samples were screened for the presence of CoVs using pan-CoV 
      real-time RT-PCR assays. The amplicons, obtained from five different species of 
      bats, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a species-specific 
      clustering with the samples from Myotis daubentonii, showing a close resemblance 
      to coronavirus sequences obtained from the same species of bat in Germany and the 
      United Kingdom. Our results show, for the first time, that multiple, distinct 
      alphacoronaviruses are present in the Danish bat populations.

AB  - Bats are important reservoir hosts for emerging viruses, including coronaviruses 
      that cause diseases in people. Although there have been several studies on the 
      pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans and surrogate animals, there is little 
      information on the interactions of these viruses with their natural bat hosts. We 
      detected a coronavirus in the intestines of 53/174 hibernating little brown bats 
      (Myotis lucifugus), as well as in the lungs of some of these individuals. 
      Interestingly, the presence of the virus was not accompanied by overt 
      inflammation. Viral RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared 
      to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the 
      archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 
      were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This 
      suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown 
      bats. Sequence variation among coronavirus detected from individual bats 
      suggested that infection occurred prior to hibernation, and that the virus 
      persisted for up to 4 months of hibernation in the laboratory. Based on the 
      sequence of its genome, the coronavirus was placed in the Alphacoronavirus genus, 
      along with some human coronaviruses, bat viruses and the porcine epidemic 
      diarrhoea virus. The detection and identification of an apparently persistent 
      coronavirus in a local bat species creates opportunities to understand the 
      dynamics of coronavirus circulation in bat populations.

TI  - Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus Enters Neuro-2a Cells via 
      Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis in a Rab5-, Cholesterol-, and pH-Dependent Manner.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01083-17 [doi]
LID - e01083-17
AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent 
      coronavirus that invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets. Although 
      important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many 
      aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular 
      mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in 
      mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section 
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of 
      PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous 
      coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic 
      pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, 
      RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled 
      virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. 
      Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by 
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and 
      Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion 
      leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics 
      of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We 
      next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5- and 
      Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive 
      infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 
      is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings 
      demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter 
      and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis 
      and guidance for antiviral drug design.IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating 
      encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded 
      RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological 
      dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the 
      detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is 
      the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an 
      acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling 
      piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry 
      pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis 
      but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. 
      Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and 
      intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first 
      report to describe the process of PHEV entry into nerve cells via 
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-, cholesterol-, and pH-dependent 
      manner that requires Rab5 and Rab7.

AB  - SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent of the large SARS outbreak in 
      2003, originated in bats. Many SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been 
      detected in bats, particularly those that reside in China, Europe, and Africa. To 
      further understand the evolutionary relationship between SARS-CoV and its 
      reservoirs, 334 bats were collected from Zhoushan city, Zhejiang province, China, 
      between 2015 and 2017. PCR amplification of the conserved coronaviral protein 
      RdRp detected coronaviruses in 26.65% of bats belonging to this region, and this 
      number was influenced by seasonal changes. Full genomic analyses of the two new 
      SL-CoVs from Zhoushan (ZXC21 and ZC45) showed that their genomes were 29,732 
      nucleotides (nt) and 29,802 nt in length, respectively, with 13 open reading 
      frames (ORFs). These results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with 
      human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for 
      bat SL-CoVs in China. Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the 
      virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies 
      showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling 
      rats by electron microscopy. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the 
      genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new 
      perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of SL-CoVs 
      using suckling rats as an animal model.

TI  - Glomerulonephritis in a ferret with feline coronavirus infection.
PG  - 637-40

AB  - A male domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo), which was purchased from outside 
      of Japan at 13 weeks of age, was euthanized at 18 months of age because of poor 
      health. At autopsy, the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node were enlarged, 
      and white foci were observed on the outer surface of the liver. The outer surface 
      of the mesenteric lymph node was dark red. Histologically, granulomas were 
      observed in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, composed mainly of 
      aggregated epithelioid macrophages, some of which were positive to an anti-feline 
      coronavirus (FCoV; Alphacoronavirus 1) antibody in immunohistochemistry. 
      Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis was observed, and periodic 
      acid-Schiff-positive deposits were observed along glomerular capillary walls. 
      These deposits stained pale red with periodic acid-methenamine silver stain and 
      red with Masson trichrome stain, and were also observed in the mesangial matrix. 
      In affected glomeruli, glomerular capillary walls and mesangial areas were 
      positive for anti-ferret immunoglobulin G. By electron microscopy, subepithelial 
      and mesangial electron-dense deposits were observed consistent with immune 
      complex deposition. The deposition of immune complexes may have been associated 
      with FCoV infection.

TI  - The persistent prevalence and evolution of cross-family recombinant coronavirus 
      GCCDC1 among a bat population: a two-year follow-up.
PG  - 1357-1363
LID - 10.1007/s11427-017-9263-6 [doi]
AB  - Bats are connected with the increasing numbers of emerging and re-emerging 
      viruses that may break the species barrier and spread into the human population. 
      Coronaviruses are one of the most common viruses discovered in bats, which were 
      considered as the natural source of recent human-susceptible coronaviruses, i.e. 
      SARS-COV and MERS-CoV. Our previous study reported the discovery of a bat-derived 
      putative cross-family recombinant coronavirus with a reovirus gene p10, named as 
      Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. In this report, through a two-year follow-up of a special bat 
      population in one specific cave of south China, we illustrate that Ro-BatCoV 
      GCCDC1 persistently circulates among bats. Notably, through the longitudinal 
      observation, we identified the dynamic evolution of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 in bats 
      represented by continuously recombination events. Our study provides the first 
      glimpse of the virus evolution in one longitudinally observed bat population 
      cohort and underlines the surveillance and pre-warning of potential interspecies 
      transmittable viruses in bats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bats have been implicated as the main reservoir of coronavirus (CoV). 
      Thus the role of these hosts on the evolution and spread of CoVs currently 
      deserve the attention of emerging diseases surveillance programs. On the view of 
      the interest on and importance of CoVs in bats the occurrence and molecular 
      characterization of CoV were conducted in bats from Brazil. FINDINGS: Three 
      hundred five enteric contents of 29 bat species were tested using a panCoV nested 
      RT-PCR. Nine specimens were positive and eight was suitable for RdRp gene 
      sequencing. RdRp gene phylogeny showed that all CoVs strains from this study 
      cluster in Alphacoronavirus genus, with one Molossidae and one 
      Phlyllostomidae-CoV specific groups. Phylogenetic analyses of two S gene 
      sequences showed a large diversity within the Alphacoronavirus genus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a CoV-to-host specificity and draws attention 
      for CoV detection in Cynomops sp, a potential new reservoir. The phylogenetic 
      analyses indicate that diversity of CoV in bats is higher than previously known.

TI  - Diversity and Evolutionary Histories of Human Coronaviruses NL63 and 229E 
      Associated with Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
PG  - 1058-64
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0810 [doi]
AB  - The human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are commonly associated with 
      upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). Information on their molecular 
      epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics in the tropical region of southeast Asia 
      however is limited. Here, we analyzed the phylogenetic, temporal distribution, 
      population history, and clinical manifestations among patients infected with 
      HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 2,060 
      consenting adults presented with acute URTI symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 
      between 2012 and 2013. The presence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was detected using 
      multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, 
      and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian 
      coalescent inference. A total of 68/2,060 (3.3%) subjects were positive for human 
      alphacoronavirus; HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected in 45 (2.2%) and 23 
      (1.1%) patients, respectively. A peak in the number of HCoV-NL63 infections was 
      recorded between June and October 2012. Phylogenetic inference revealed that 
      62.8% of HCoV-NL63 infections belonged to genotype B, 37.2% was genotype C, while 
      all HCoV-229E sequences were clustered within group 4. Molecular dating analysis 
      indicated that the origin of HCoV-NL63 was dated to 1921, before it diverged into 
      genotype A (1975), genotype B (1996), and genotype C (2003). The root of the 
      HCoV-229E tree was dated to 1955, before it diverged into groups 1-4 between the 
      1970s and 1990s. The study described the seasonality, molecular diversity, and 
      evolutionary dynamics of human alphacoronavirus infections in a tropical region.

TI  - Structural Basis for the Inhibition of Host Gene Expression by Porcine Epidemic 
      Diarrhea Virus nsp1.

LID - e01896-17
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic Alphacoronavirus, has 
      caused enormous economic losses in the pork industry. Nonstructural protein 1 
      (nsp1) is a characteristic feature of alpha- and betacoronaviruses, which 
      exhibits both functional conservation and mechanistic diversity in inhibiting 
      host gene expression and antiviral responses. However, the detailed structure and 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the Alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibition of host gene 
      expression remain unclear. Here, we report the first full-length crystal 
      structure of Alphacoronavirus nsp1 from PEDV. The structure displays a 
      six-stranded β-barrel fold in the middle of two α-helices. The core structure of 
      PEDV nsp1 shows high similarity to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp1 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nsp1, 
      despite its low degree of sequence homology. Using ribopuromycylation and Renilla 
      luciferase reporter assays, we showed that PEDV nsp1 can dramatically inhibit 
      general host gene expression. Furthermore, three motifs (amino acids [aa] 67 to 
      71, 78 to 85, and 103 to 110) of PEDV nsp1 create a stable functional region for 
      inhibiting protein synthesis, differing considerably from Betacoronavirus nsp1. 
      These results elucidate the detailed structural basis through which PEDV nsp1 
      inhibits host gene expression, providing insight into the development of a new 
      attenuated vaccine with nsp1 modifications.IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea 
      virus (PEDV) has led to tremendous economic losses in the global swine industry. 
      PEDV nsp1 plays a crucial role in inhibiting host gene expression, but its 
      functional mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report the full-length structure 
      of PEDV nsp1, the first among coronaviruses to be reported. The 1.25-Å resolution 
      crystal structure of PEDV nsp1 shows high similarity to severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp1(13-128) and transmissible gastroenteritis 
      virus (TGEV) nsp1(1-104), despite a lack of sequence homology. Structural and 
      biochemical characterization demonstrated that PEDV nsp1 possesses a stable 
      functional region for inhibition of host protein synthesis, which is formed by 
      loops at residues 67 to 71, 78 to 85, and 103 to 110. The different functional 
      regions in PEDV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 may explain their distinct mechanisms. 
      Importantly, our structural data are conducive to understanding the mechanism of 
      PEDV nsp1 inhibition of the expression of host genes and may aid in the 
      development of a new attenuated vaccine.

TI  - Mutagenesis of Coronavirus nsp14 Reveals Its Potential Role in Modulation of the 
      Innate Immune Response.
PG  - 5399-5414
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03259-15 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a 60-kDa protein encoded by 
      the replicase gene that is part of the replication-transcription complex. It is a 
      bifunctional enzyme bearing 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and 
      guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. ExoN hydrolyzes 
      single-stranded RNAs and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and is part of a 
      proofreading system responsible for the high fidelity of CoV replication. nsp14 
      N7-MTase activity is required for viral mRNA cap synthesis and prevents the 
      recognition of viral mRNAs as "non-self" by the host cell. In this work, a set of 
      point mutants affecting different motifs within the ExoN domain of nsp14 was 
      generated, using transmissible gastroenteritis virus as a model of 
      Alphacoronavirus Mutants lacking ExoN activity were nonviable despite being 
      competent in both viral RNA and protein synthesis. A specific mutation within 
      zinc finger 1 (ZF-C) led to production of a viable virus with growth and viral 
      RNA synthesis kinetics similar to that of the parental virus. Mutant recombinant 
      transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) ZF-C (rTGEV-ZF-C) caused decreased 
      cytopathic effect and apoptosis compared with the wild-type virus and reduced 
      levels of dsRNA accumulation at late times postinfection. Consequently, the 
      mutant triggered a reduced antiviral response, which was confirmed by evaluating 
      different stages of the dsRNA-induced antiviral pathway. The expression of beta 
      interferon (IFN-β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon-stimulated genes 
      in cells infected with mutant rTGEV-ZF-C was reduced compared to the levels seen 
      with the parental virus. Overall, our data revealed a potential role for CoV 
      nsp14 in modulation of the innate immune response. IMPORTANCE: The innate immune 
      response is the first line of antiviral defense that culminates in the synthesis 
      of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines to control viral replication. CoVs 
      have evolved several mechanisms to counteract the innate immune response at 
      different levels, but the role of CoV-encoded ribonucleases in preventing 
      activation of the dsRNA-induced antiviral response has not been described to 
      date. The introduction of a mutation in zinc finger 1 of the ExoN domain of nsp14 
      led to production of a virus that induced a weak antiviral response, most likely 
      due to the accumulation of lower levels of dsRNA in the late phases of infection. 
      These observations allowed us to propose a novel role for CoV nsp14 ExoN activity 
      in counteracting the antiviral response, which could serve as a novel target for 
      the design of antiviral strategies.

LID - 10.1128/JVI.03196-14 [doi]
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus 
      (TGEV) are economically important swine enteropathogenic coronaviruses. These two 
      viruses belong to two distinct species of the Alphacoronavirus genus within 
      Coronaviridae and induce similar clinical signs and pathological lesions in 
      newborn piglets, but they are presumed to be antigenically distinct. In the 
      present study, two-way antigenic cross-reactivity examinations between the 
      prototype PEDV CV777 strain, three distinct U.S. PEDV strains (the original 
      highly virulent PC22A, S indel Iowa106, and S 197del PC177), and two 
      representative U.S. TGEV strains (Miller and Purdue) were conducted by cell 
      culture immunofluorescent (CCIF) and viral neutralization (VN) assays. None of 
      the pig TGEV antisera neutralized PEDV and vice versa. One-way cross-reactions 
      were observed by CCIF between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and all PEDV 
      strains. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblotting using monoclonal 
      antibodies and Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant PEDV and TGEV nucleocapsid 
      (N) proteins, and sequence analysis suggested at least one epitope on the 
      N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV N protein that contributed to this 
      cross-reactivity. Biologically, PEDV strain CV777 induced greater cell fusion in 
      Vero cells than did U.S. PEDV strains. Consistent with the reported genetic 
      differences, the results of CCIF and VN assays also revealed higher antigenic 
      variation between PEDV CV777 and U.S. strains. IMPORTANCE: Evidence of antigenic 
      cross-reactivity between porcine enteric coronaviruses, PEDV and TGEV, in CCIF 
      assays supports the idea that these two species are evolutionarily related, but 
      they are distinct species defined by VN assays. Identification of PEDV- or 
      TGEV-specific antigenic regions allows the development of more specific 
      immunoassays for each virus. Antigenic and biologic variations between the 
      prototype and current PEDV strains could explain, at least partially, the 
      recurrence of PEDV epidemics. Information on the conserved antigenicity among 
      PEDV strains is important for the development of PEDV vaccines to protect swine 
      from current highly virulent PEDV infections.

TI  - Airway Memory CD4(+) T Cells Mediate Protective Immunity against Emerging 
      Respiratory Coronaviruses.

AB  - Two zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs)-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-have crossed species to 
      cause severe human respiratory disease. Here, we showed that induction of airway 
      memory CD4(+) T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and 
      MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing pan-coronavirus vaccines. Airway 
      memory CD4(+) T cells differed phenotypically and functionally from lung-derived 
      cells and were crucial for protection against both CoVs in mice. Protection was 
      dependent on interferon-γ and required early induction of robust innate and 
      virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized 
      in SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic 
      mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this 
      epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many 
      human CoVs. Vaccine strategies that induce airway memory CD4(+) T cells targeting 
      conserved epitopes might have broad applicability in the context of new CoVs and 
      other respiratory virus outbreaks.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a highly pathogenic strain of Porcine enteric 
      alphacoronavirus causing watery diarrhoea and high mortality in newborn piglets.
PG  - 119-130
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12992 [doi]
AB  - Porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) was first discovered in China in February 
      2017, and the origin and virulence of this novel porcine coronavirus were not 
      fully characterized. Here, we isolated a strain of PEAV, named GDS04 that is 
      identified by immunofluorescence and typical crown-shaped particles observed with 
      electron microscopy. Genomic analysis reveals that PEAV GDS04 shares a close 
      relationship with SADS-CoV and SeACoV. Furthermore, newborn piglets orally 
      challenged with PEAV GDS04 developed typical clinical symptoms as watery 
      diarrhoea in neonatal piglets. Viral RNA was detected in faeces and various 
      tissues of the infected piglets. Moreover, macroscopic and microscopic lesions in 
      whole intestinal tract were observed, and viral antigen could be detected in the 
      small intestines by immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy. 
      Importantly, the mortality rate of inoculated-newborn piglets was 100% and half 
      of the cohabiting piglets died. Collectively, we demonstrate that PEAV is highly 
      pathogenic in newborn piglets.

TI  - Co-circulation of three camel coronavirus species and recombination of MERS-CoVs 
      in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 81-4
LID - 10.1126/science.aac8608 [doi]
AB  - Outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) raise questions about the 
      prevalence and evolution of the MERS coronavirus (CoV) in its animal reservoir. 
      Our surveillance in Saudi Arabia in 2014 and 2015 showed that viruses of the 
      MERS-CoV species and a human CoV 229E-related lineage co-circulated at high 
      prevalence, with frequent co-infections in the upper respiratory tract of 
      dromedary camels. viruses of the betacoronavirus 1 species, we found that 
      dromedary camels share three CoV species with humans. Several MERS-CoV lineages 
      were present in camels, including a recombinant lineage that has been dominant 
      since December 2014 and that subsequently led to the human outbreaks in 2015. 
      Camels therefore serve as an important reservoir for the maintenance and 
      diversification of the MERS-CoVs and are the source of human infections with this 
      virus.

AB  - We describe molecular testing for felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), carnivore 
      protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), alphacoronavirus 1 (feline 
      coronavirus [FCoV]), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus 
      (FIV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) in whole blood samples of 109 
      free-ranging and 68 captive neotropical felids from Brazil. Samples from 2 
      jaguars ( Panthera onca) and 1 oncilla ( Leopardus tigrinus) were positive for 
      FHV-1; 2 jaguars, 1 puma ( Puma concolor), and 1 jaguarundi ( Herpairulus 
      yagouaroundi) tested positive for CPPV-1; and 1 puma was positive for FIV. Based 
      on comparison of 103 nucleotides of the UL24-UL25 gene, the FHV-1 sequences were 
      99-100% similar to the FHV-1 strain of domestic cats. Nucleotide sequences of 
      CPPV-1 were closely related to sequences detected in other wild carnivores, 
      comparing 294 nucleotides of the VP1 gene. The FIV nucleotide sequence detected 
      in the free-ranging puma, based on comparison of 444 nucleotides of the pol gene, 
      grouped with other lentiviruses described in pumas, and had 82.4% identity with a 
      free-ranging puma from Yellowstone Park and 79.5% with a captive puma from 
      Brazil. Our data document the circulation of FHV-1, CPPV-1, and FIV in 
      neotropical felids in Brazil.

TI  - The papain-like protease determines a virulence trait that varies among members 
      of the SARS-coronavirus species.
PG  - e1007296
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007296 [doi]
LID - e1007296
AB  - SARS-coronavirus (CoV) is a zoonotic agent derived from rhinolophid bats, in 
      which a plethora of SARS-related, conspecific viral lineages exist. Whereas the 
      variability of virulence among reservoir-borne viruses is unknown, it is 
      generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs 
      requires human adaptation. To understand the influence of a viral factor in 
      relation to interspecies spillover, we studied the papain-like protease (PLP) of 
      SARS-CoV. This key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the 
      viral polyprotein, deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins, and antagonizes 
      the interferon (IFN) response. We identified a bat SARS-CoV PLP, which shared 86% 
      amino acid identity with SARS-CoV PLP, and used reverse genetics to insert it 
      into the SARS-CoV genome. The resulting virus replicated like SARS-CoV in Vero 
      cells but was suppressed in IFN competent MA-104 (3.7-fold), Calu-3 (2.6-fold) 
      and human airway epithelial cells (10.3-fold). Using ectopically-expressed PLP 
      variants as well as full SARS-CoV infectious clones chimerized for PLP, we found 
      that a protease-independent, anti-IFN function exists in SARS-CoV, but not in a 
      SARS-related, bat-borne virus. This PLP-mediated anti-IFN difference was seen in 
      primate, human as well as bat cells, thus independent of the host context. The 
      results of this study revealed that coronavirus PLP confers a variable virulence 
      trait among members of the species SARS-CoV, and that a SARS-CoV lineage with 
      virulent PLPs may have pre-existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic.

TI  - Hepatitis E virus seroprevalence, seroincidence and seroreversion in the German 
      adult population.
PG  - 752-758

AB  - A steep rise in Hepatitis E diagnoses is currently being observed in Germany and 
      other European countries. The objective of this study was (i) to assess whether 
      this trend mirrors an increase in infection pressure or is caused by increased 
      attention and testing and (ii) estimate individual and population-based Hepatitis 
      E Virus (HEV) seroconversion and seroreversion rates for Germany. We measured 
      anti-HEV IgG prevalence in 10 407 adults participating in two linked, 
      population-representative serosurveys (total n = 12 971) conducted in 1998 and 
      2010. In this period, we found a moderate but statistically significant decline 
      of overall anti-HEV IgG prevalence from 18.6% to 15.3%. At both time points, 
      seroprevalence increased with age and peaked in persons born between 1935 and 
      1959 suggesting a past period of increased infection pressure. Paired samples of 
      individuals participating in 1998 and 2010 (n = 2564) revealed respective 
      seroconversion and seroreversion rates of 6.2% and 22.6% among seronegative and 
      seropositive individuals during 12 years, or 5.2 and 2.9 per 1000 inhabitants per 
      year. This corresponds to a total of 417 242 [95%CI: 344 363-495 971] new 
      seroconversions per year in the German population. While anti-HEV seroprevalence 
      has decreased in the last decade, infection pressure and seroincidence remains 
      high in Germany. Continuously rising numbers of Hepatitis E diagnoses in Europe 
      are likely due to an increased awareness of clinicians and indicate that still 
      there is a gap between incident and diagnosed cases. Studies on the true burden 
      of the disease, specific risk factors and sources of autochthonous infections as 
      well as targeted prevention measures are urgently needed.

TI  - Ulk1 Governs Nerve Growth Factor/TrkA Signaling by Mediating Rab5 GTPase 
      Activation in Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus-Induced 
      Neurodegenerative Disorders.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00325-18 [doi]
LID - e00325-18
AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent 
      coronavirus and causes neurological dysfunction in the central nervous system 
      (CNS), but the neuropathological mechanism of PHEV remains poorly understood. We 
      report that Unc51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1/Unc51.1) is a pivotal regulator of 
      PHEV-induced neurological disorders and functions to selectively control the 
      initiation of nerve growth factor (NGF)/TrkA endosome trafficking. We first 
      identified the function of Ulk1 by histopathologic evaluation in a PHEV-infected 
      mouse model in which neuronal loss was accompanied by the suppression of Ulk1 
      expression. Morphogenesis assessments in the primary cortical neurons revealed 
      that overexpression or mutations of Ulk1 modulated neurite outgrowth, collateral 
      sprouting, and endosomal transport. Likewise, Ulk1 expression was decreased 
      following PHEV infection, suggesting that there was a correlation between the 
      neurodegeneration and functional Ulk1 deficiency. We then showed that Ulk1 forms 
      a multiprotein complex with TrkA and the early endosome marker Rab5 and that Ulk1 
      defects lead to either blocking of NGF/TrkA endocytosis or premature degradation 
      of pTrkA via constitutive activation of the Rab5 GTPase. Further investigation 
      determined that the ectopic expression of Rab5 mutants induces aberrant endosomal 
      accumulation of activated pTrkA, proving that targeting of Ulk1-TrkA-NGF 
      signaling to the retrograde transport route in the neurodegenerative process that 
      underlies PHEV infection is dependent on Rab5 GTPase activity. Therefore, we 
      described a long-distance signaling mechanism of PHEV-driven deficits in neurons 
      and suggested that such Ulk1 repression may result in limited NGF/TrkA retrograde 
      signaling within activated Rab5 endosomes, explaining the progressive failure of 
      neurite outgrowth and survival.IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating 
      encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a neurotropic coronavirus and targets neurons 
      in the nervous system for proliferation, frequently leaving behind grievous 
      neurodegeneration. Structural plasticity disorders occur in the axons, dendrites, 
      and dendritic spines of PHEV-infected neurons, and dysfunction of this neural 
      process may contribute to neurologic pathologies, but the mechanisms remain 
      undetermined. Further understanding of the neurological manifestations underlying 
      PHEV infection in the CNS may provide insights into both neurodevelopmental and 
      neurodegenerative diseases that may be conducive to targeted approaches for 
      treatment. The significance of our research is in identifying an Ulk1-related 
      neurodegenerative mechanism, focusing on the regulatory functions of Ulk1 in the 
      transport of long-distance trophic signaling endosomes, thereby explaining the 
      progressive failure of neurite outgrowth and survival associated with PHEV 
      aggression. This is the first report to define a mechanistic link between 
      alterations in signaling from endocytic pathways and the neuropathogenesis of 
      PHEV-induced CNS disease.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic Alphacoronavirus, has 
      caused enormous economic losses in the swine industry. p53 protein exists in a 
      wide variety of animal cells, which is involved in cell cycle regulation, 
      apoptosis, cell differentiation and other biological functions. In this study, we 
      investigated the effects of PEDV infection on the cell cycle of Vero cells and 
      p53 activation. The results demonstrated that PEDV infection induces cell cycle 
      arrest at G0/G1 phase in Vero cells, while UV-inactivated PEDV does not cause 
      cell cycle arrest. PEDV infection up-regulates the levels of p21, cdc2, cdk2, 
      cdk4, Cyclin A protein and down-regulates Cyclin E protein. Further research 
      results showed that inhibition of p53 signaling pathway can reverse the cell 
      cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase induced by PEDV infection and cancel out the 
      up-regulation of p21 and corresponding Cyclin/cdk mentioned above. In addition, 
      PEDV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed 
      that viral subgenomic RNA and virus titer were higher in the cells released from 
      G0/G1 phase synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G1/S 
      phase and G2/M phase synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i.. This is 
      the first report to demonstrate that the p53-dependent pathway plays an important 
      role in PEDV induced cell cycle arrest and beneficially contributes to viral 
      infection.

LID - 10.1177/1040638714559026 [doi]
AB  - Bovine coronavirus (BoCV; Betacoronavirus 1) infections are associated with 
      varied clinical presentations including neonatal diarrhea, winter dysentery in 
      dairy cattle, and respiratory disease in various ages of cattle. The current 
      report presents information on BoCV infections associated with enteric disease of 
      postweaned beef cattle in Oklahoma. In 3 separate accessions from a single herd, 
      1 in 2012 and 2 in 2013, calves were observed with bloody diarrhea. One calf in 
      2012 died and was necropsied, and 2 calves from this herd died in 2013 and were 
      necropsied. A third calf from another herd died and was necropsied. The gross and 
      histologic diagnosis was acute, hemorrhagic colitis in all 4 cattle. Colonic 
      tissues from all 4 animals were positive by fluorescent antibody testing and/or 
      immunohistochemical staining for BoCV antigen. Bovine coronavirus was isolated in 
      human rectal tumor cells from swabs of colon surfaces of all animals. The genomic 
      information from a region of the S envelope region revealed BoCV clade 2. 
      Detection of BoCV clade 2 in beef cattle in Oklahoma is consistent with recovery 
      of BoCV clade 2 from the respiratory tract of postweaned beef calves that had 
      respiratory disease signs or were healthy. Further investigations on the ecology 
      of BoCV in cattle are important, as BoCV may be an emerging disease beyond the 
      initial descriptions. Challenge studies are needed to determine pathogenicity of 
      these strains, and to determine if current BoCV vaccines are efficacious against 
      the BoCV clade 2 strains.

TI  - The nsp1, nsp13, and M proteins contribute to the hepatotropism of murine 
      coronavirus JHM.WU.
PG  - 3598-609
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03535-14 [doi]
AB  - Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) isolates JHM.WU and JHM.SD promote severe central 
      nervous system disease. However, while JHM.WU replicates robustly and induces 
      hepatitis, JHM.SD fails to replicate or induce pathology in the liver. These two 
      JHM variants encode homologous proteins with few polymorphisms, and little is 
      known about which viral proteins(s) is responsible for the liver tropism of 
      JHM.WU. We constructed reverse genetic systems for JHM.SD and JHM.WU and, 
      utilizing these full-length cDNA clones, constructed chimeric viruses and mapped 
      the virulence factors involved in liver tropism. Exchanging the spike proteins of 
      the two viruses neither increased replication of JHM.SD in the liver nor 
      attenuated JHM.WU. By further mapping, we found that polymorphisms in JHM.WU 
      structural protein M and nonstructural replicase proteins nsp1 and nsp13 are 
      essential for liver pathogenesis. M protein and nsp13, the helicase, of JHM.WU 
      are required for efficient replication in vitro and in the liver in vivo. The 
      JHM.SD nsp1 protein contains a K194R substitution of Lys194, a residue conserved 
      among all other MHV strains. The K194R polymorphism has no effect on in vitro 
      replication but influences hepatotropism, and introduction of R194K into JHM.SD 
      promotes replication in the liver. Conversely, a K194R substitution in nsp1 of 
      JHM.WU or A59, another hepatotropic strain, significantly attenuates replication 
      of each strain in the liver and increases IFN-β expression in macrophages in 
      culture. Our data indicate that both structural and nonstructural proteins 
      contribute to MHV liver pathogenesis and support previous reports that nsp1 is a 
      Betacoronavirus virulence factor. IMPORTANCE: The Betacoronavirus genus includes 
      human pathogens, some of which cause severe respiratory disease. The spread of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) into human populations demonstrates 
      the zoonotic potential of emerging coronaviruses, and there are currently no 
      vaccines or effective antivirals for human coronaviruses. Thus, it is important 
      to understand the virus-host interaction that regulates coronavirus pathogenesis. 
      Murine coronavirus infection of mice provides a useful model for the study of 
      coronavirus-host interactions, including the determinants of tropism and 
      virulence. We found that very small changes in coronavirus proteins can 
      profoundly affect tropism and virulence. Furthermore, the hepatotropism of 
      MHV-JHM depends not on the spike protein and viral entry but rather on a 
      combination of the structural protein M and nonstructural replicase-associated 
      proteins nsp1 and nsp13, which are conserved among betacoronaviruses. 
      Understanding virulence determinants will aid in the design of vaccines and 
      antiviral strategies.

AB  - To investigate bat coronaviruses (CoVs), we collected 132 rectal swabs and urine 
      samples from five bat species in three countries in southwestern China. Seven 
      CoVs belonging to distinct groups of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS)-like CoVs and α-CoVs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats. 
      Samples from other bat species were negative for these viruses, indicating that 
      the least horseshoe bat represents one of the natural reservoirs and mixers for 
      strains of CoVs and has a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of 
      these viruses. The genetic and evolutionary characteristics of these strains were 
      described. Whole-genome sequencing of a new isolate (F46) from a rectal swab from 
      a least horseshoe bat showed that it contained 29 699 nucleotides, excluding the 
      poly (A) tail, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic and recombination 
      analyses of F46 provided evidence of natural recombination between bat SARS-like 
      CoVs (Rs3367 and LYRa11) or SARS-CoV (BJ01), suggesting that F46 could be a new 
      recombinant virus from SARS-like CoVs or SARS-CoVs.

LID - 115
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) belong to the genus Betacoronavirus of the 
      family Coronaviridae. BCoV are widespread around the world and cause enteric or 
      respiratory infections among cattle, leading to important economic losses to the 
      beef and dairy industry worldwide. To study the relation of codon usage among 
      viruses and their hosts is essential to understand host-pathogen interaction, 
      evasion from host's immune system and evolution. METHODS: We performed a 
      comprehensive analysis of codon usage and composition of BCoV. RESULTS: The 
      global codon usage among BCoV strains is similar. Significant differences of 
      codon preferences in BCoV genes in relation to codon usage of Bos taurus host 
      genes were found. Most of the highly frequent codons are U-ending. G + C 
      compositional constraint and dinucleotide composition also plays a role in the 
      overall pattern of BCoV codon usage. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies 
      revealed that mutational bias is a leading force shaping codon usage in this 
      virus. Additionally, relative dinucleotide frequencies, geographical 
      distribution, and evolutionary processes also influenced the codon usage pattern.

TI  - Investigation of an experimental infection model of equine coronavirus in adult 
      horses.
PG  - 2099-2104
LID - 10.1111/jvim.15318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a recently reported enteric disease of 
      adult horses. Natural infection by ECoV has been reported in adult horses 
      worldwide, whereas experimental infection has only been reported in juvenile 
      horses. An experimental infection model is needed to study the clinical 
      presentation, laboratory abnormalities, and pathophysiological changes associated 
      with ECoV. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, hematologic, molecular, and 
      serological features of adult horses experimentally infected with ECoV. ANIMALS: 
      Eight adult horses. METHODS: Four horses were intragastrically infected with 
      fecal material containing 10(9) genome equivalents of ECoV. Four additional 
      horses were exposed daily to the feces from the experimentally-infected horses. 
      Monitoring included physical examinations, as well as daily nasal swab, whole 
      blood, and fecal collection for molecular detection of ECoV. Blood was collected 
      every other day for hematologic analysis and weekly for serologic analysis. 
      RESULTS: All 8 horses shed ECoV in feces. Six of the 8 horses (75%) exhibited 
      mild, clinical disease with soft, formed manure; 1 horse exhibited transient 
      pyrexia. All horses maintained total white cell counts within normal limits, but 
      3 horses developed transient lymphopenia. No statistically significant 
      differences (P = .20) were observed in quantity of fecal shedding of ECoV between 
      the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Experimental infection of 
      adult horses with ECoV was associated with mild and self-limiting clinical signs, 
      transient lymphopenia, and fecal shedding of ECoV, which mimics natural 
      infection. No differences between experimentally-infected horses and horses 
      exposed to ECoV-containing feces were identified. Results of our study support a 
      fecal-oral route of transmission.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been documented in almost every species of bat sampled. 
      Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range, 
      indicative of a long-standing host association. Despite this, the respective 
      roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission 
      (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear. Using a 
      phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by 
      both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit 
      clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely 
      associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that 
      cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence across 
      coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were 
      more likely between sympatric bat hosts. Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV 
      RNA polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in 
      short-term spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward 
      transmission in new co-roosting host species.

TI  - Crystal structure of the post-fusion core of the Human coronavirus 229E spike

AB  - Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) usually causes mild upper respiratory 
      infections in heathy adults, but may lead to severe complications or mortality in 
      individuals with weakened immune systems. Virus entry of HCoV-229E is mediated by 
      its spike (S) protein, where the S1 domain facilitates attachment to host cells 
      and the S2 domain is involved in subsequent fusion of the virus and host 
      membranes. During the fusion process, two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, in the S2 
      domain assemble into a six-helix membrane-fusion structure termed the fusion 
      core. Here, the complete fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E has been determined 
      at 1.86 Å resolution, representing the most complete post-fusion conformation 
      thus far among published human alphacoronavirus (α-HCoV) fusion-core structures. 
      The overall structure of the HCoV-229E fusion core is similar to those of SARS, 
      MERS and HCoV-NL63, but the packing of its 3HR1 core differs from those of SARS 
      and MERS in that it contains more noncanonical `x' and `da' layers. Side-by-side 
      electrostatic surface comparisons reveal that the electrostatic surface 
      potentials are opposite in α-HCoVs and β-HCoVs at certain positions and that the 
      HCoV-229E surface also appears to be the most hydrophobic among the various 
      HCoVs. In addition to the highly conserved hydrophobic interactions between HR1 
      and HR2, some polar and electrostatic interactions are also well preserved across 
      different HCoVs. This study adds to the structural profiling of HCoVs to aid in 
      the structure-based design of pan-coronavirus small molecules or peptides to 
      inhibit viral fusion.

TI  - Retrospective detection and phylogenetic analysis of swine acute diarrhoea 
      syndrome coronavirus in pigs in southern China.
PG  - 687-695
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13008 [doi]
AB  - Swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a novel coronavirus, was 
      first discovered in southern China in January 2017 and caused a large scale 
      outbreak of fatal diarrheal disease in piglets. Here, we conducted a 
      retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 swine farms with a clinical 
      history of diarrheal disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of 
      SADS-CoV in pigs in China. Our results suggest that SADS-CoV has emerged in China 
      at least since August 2016. Meanwhile, we detected a prevalence of SADS-CoV 
      (43.53%), porcine deltacoronavirus (8.83%), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus 
      (PEDV) (78.25%), rotavirus (21.77%), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus 
      (0%), and we also found the co-infection of SADS-CoV and PEDV occurred most 
      frequently with the rate of 17.65%. We screened and obtained two new complete 
      genomes, five N and five S genes of SADS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis based on 
      these sequences revealed that all SADS-CoV sequences in this study clustered with 
      previously reported SADS-CoV strains to form a well defined branch that grouped 
      with the bat coronavirus HKU2 strains. This study is the first retrospective 
      investigation for SADS-CoV and provides the epidemiological information of this 
      new virus in China, which highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to 
      control SADS-CoV.

AB  - Spillover of viruses from bats to other animals may be associated with increased 
      contact between them, as well as increased shedding of viruses by bats. Here, we 
      tested the prediction that little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) co-infected with 
      the M. lucifugus coronavirus (Myl-CoV) and with Pseudogymnoascus destructans 
      (Pd), the fungus that causes bat white-nose syndrome (WNS), exhibit different 
      disease severity, viral shedding and molecular responses than bats infected with 
      only Myl-CoV or only P. destructans. We took advantage of the natural persistence 
      of Myl-CoV in bats that were experimentally inoculated with P. destructans in a 
      previous study. Here, we show that the intestines of virus-infected bats that 
      were also infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more viral RNA than 
      bats with virus alone. Increased viral RNA in the intestines correlated with the 
      severity of fungus-related pathology. Additionally, the intestines of bats 
      infected with fungus exhibited different expression of mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase pathway and cytokine related transcripts, irrespective of viral presence. 
      Levels of coronavirus antibodies were also higher in fungal-infected bats. Our 
      results suggest that the systemic effects of WNS may down-regulate anti-viral 
      responses in bats persistently infected with M. lucifugus coronavirus and 
      increase the potential of virus shedding.

TI  - The PERK Arm of the Unfolded Protein Response Negatively Regulates Transmissible 
      Gastroenteritis Virus Replication by Suppressing Protein Translation and 
      Promoting Type I Interferon Production.

AB  - Coronavirus replication is closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER), the primary cellular organelle for protein synthesis, folding, and 
      modification. ER stress is a common consequence in coronavirus-infected cells. 
      However, how the virus-induced ER stress influences coronavirus replication and 
      pathogenesis remains controversial. Here, we demonstrated that infection with the 
      alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced ER stress and 
      triggered the unfolded protein response (UPR) in vitro and in vivo, and ER stress 
      negatively regulated TGEV replication in vitro Although TGEV infection activated 
      all three UPR pathways (activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6], 
      inositol-requiring enzyme 1 [IRE1], and protein kinase R-like ER kinase [PERK]), 
      the virus-triggered UPR suppressed TGEV replication in both swine testicular (ST) 
      and IPEC-J2 cells primarily through activation of the PERK-eukaryotic initiation 
      factor 2α (eIF2α) axis, as shown by functional studies with overexpression, small 
      interfering RNA (siRNA), or specific chemical inhibitors. Moreover, we 
      demonstrated that PERK-eIF2α axis-mediated inhibition of TGEV replication occurs 
      through phosphorylated eIF2α-induced overall attenuation of protein translation. 
      In addition to direct inhibition of viral production, the PERK-eIF2α pathway 
      activated NF-κB and then facilitated type I IFN production, resulting in TGEV 
      suppression. Taken together, our results suggest that the TGEV-triggered 
      PERK-eIF2α pathway negatively regulates TGEV replication and represents a vital 
      aspect of host innate responses to invading pathogens.IMPORTANCE The induction of 
      ER stress is a common outcome in cells infected with coronaviruses. The UPR 
      initiated by ER stress is actively involved in viral replication and modulates 
      the host innate responses to the invading viruses, but these underlying 
      mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We show here that infection with the 
      alphacoronavirus TGEV elicited ER stress in vitro and in vivo, and the UPR 
      PERK-eIF2α branch was predominantly responsible for the suppression of TGEV 
      replication by ER stress. Furthermore, the PERK-eIF2α axis inhibited TGEV 
      replication through direct inhibition of viral proteins due to global translation 
      inhibition and type I IFN induction. These findings highlight a critical role of 
      the UPR PERK-eIF2α pathway in modulating host innate immunity and coronavirus 
      replication.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 as a 
      highly transmissible pathogenic human betacoronavirus. The viral spike 
      glycoprotein (S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host 
      protein receptor and mediates fusion of the viral and host membranes, making S 
      essential to viral entry into host cells and host species tropism. As SARS-CoV 
      enters host cells, the viral S is believed to undergo a number of conformational 
      transitions as it is cleaved by host proteases and binds to host receptors. We 
      recently developed stabilizing mutations for coronavirus spikes that prevent the 
      transition from the pre-fusion to post-fusion states. Here, we present cryo-EM 
      analyses of a stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV S, as well as the trypsin-cleaved, 
      stabilized S, and its interactions with ACE2. Neither binding to ACE2 nor 
      cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational 
      changes within stabilized SARS-CoV S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2'.

TI  - A metagenomic viral discovery approach identifies potential zoonotic and novel 
      mammalian viruses in Neoromicia bats within South Africa.

AB  - Species within the Neoromicia bat genus are abundant and widely distributed in 
      Africa. It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic 
      structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously 
      been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal 
      virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be 
      replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of 
      coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of 
      South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral 
      metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. 
      Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, 
      producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high 
      throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the 
      Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, 
      Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and 
      Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to 
      determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage 
      of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected 
      from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting 
      conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae 
      families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences 
      to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related 
      coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq 
      platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous 
      Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional 
      PCR analysis detected diverse adenovirus and herpesvirus sequences that were 
      widespread throughout Neoromicia populations in South Africa. Furthermore, 
      similar adenovirus sequences were detected within these populations throughout 
      several years. With the exception of the coronaviruses, the study represents the 
      first report of sequence data from several viral families within a Southern 
      African insectivorous bat genus; highlighting the need for continued 
      investigations in this regard.

TI  - Kanyawara Virus: A Novel Rhabdovirus Infecting Newly Discovered Nycteribiid Bat 
      Flies Infesting Previously Unknown Pteropodid Bats in Uganda.

AB  - Bats are natural reservoir hosts of highly virulent pathogens such as Marburg 
      virus, Nipah virus, and SARS coronavirus. However, little is known about the role 
      of bat ectoparasites in transmitting and maintaining such viruses. The intricate 
      relationship between bats and their ectoparasites suggests that ectoparasites 
      might serve as viral vectors, but evidence to date is scant. Bat flies, in 
      particular, are highly specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that 
      incidentally bite humans. Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered a novel 
      ledantevirus (mononegaviral family Rhabdoviridae, genus Ledantevirus) in 
      nycteribiid bat flies infesting pteropodid bats in western Uganda. Mitochondrial 
      DNA analyses revealed that both the bat flies and their bat hosts belong to 
      putative new species. The coding-complete genome of the new virus, named 
      Kanyawara virus (KYAV), is only distantly related to that of its closest known 
      relative, Mount Elgon bat virus, and was found at high titers in bat flies but 
      not in blood or on mucosal surfaces of host bats. Viral genome analysis indicates 
      unusually low CpG dinucleotide depletion in KYAV compared to other ledanteviruses 
      and rhabdovirus groups, with KYAV displaying values similar to rhabdoviruses of 
      arthropods. Our findings highlight the possibility of a yet-to-be-discovered 
      diversity of potentially pathogenic viruses in bat ectoparasites.

TI  - Coronaviruses in guano from Pteropus medius bats in Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.

AB  - Bats are a unique group of mammals well suited to be hosts for emerging viruses. 
      With current rates of deforestation and urbanization, redistribution of bat 
      habitats to urban and suburban areas may bring bats into closer contact with 
      livestock and humans. Common flying fox, Pteropus medius (previously known as 
      Pteropus giganteus), forms large communal roosts on treetops, often in close 
      proximity to human habitation in Sri Lanka. This report describes the detection 
      of coronavirus RNA in P. medius bat guano collected in Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. 
      These viruses had >97% nucleotide identity with coronaviruses detected in 
      Cynopterus sphinx, Scotophilus heathii and S. kuhlii bats in Thailand. Pteropus 
      medius is widespread in Asia and appears to excrete group D coronaviruses, which 
      are hitherto confined to bats; however, these findings may have public health 
      implications in the future.

TI  - A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex real-time RT-qPCR for simultaneous detection of 
      porcine enteric coronaviruses.
PG  - 4943-4952
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-09835-7 [doi]
AB  - Swine enteric coronaviruses are a group of most significant pathogens causing 
      diarrhea in piglets with similar clinical symptoms and pathological changes. To 
      develop a simple, rapid, accurate, and high-throughput detection method for 
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis on swine enteric coronaviruses, specific 
      primers and probes were designed based on the highly conserved regions of 
      transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 
      (PEDV) M, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) M, and porcine enteric 
      alphacoronavirus (PEAV) N genes respectively. A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex 
      real-time RT-qPCR assay was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect 
      these swine enteric coronaviruses. The results showed that the limit of detection 
      can reach as low as 10 copies in singular real-time RT-qPCR assays and 100 copies 
      in multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay, with all correlation coefficients (R(2)) at 
      above 0.99, and the amplification efficiency at between 90 and 120%. This 
      multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity, extreme 
      specificity, and excellent repeatability. The multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay 
      was then employed to detect the swine enteric coronavirus from 354 field 
      diarrheal samples. The results manifested that TGEV and PDCoV were the main 
      pathogens in these samples, accompanied by co-infections. This well-established 
      multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay provided a rapid, efficient, specific, and 
      sensitive tool for detection of swine enteric coronaviruses.

AB  - Bats carry a variety of viruses, and some of them cause public health problems. 
      Macau, which is famous for its gambling industry, has a complex population 
      structure. The globalization in such an international metropolis has enhanced the 
      chance of disease transmission. Therefore, surveillance of zoonotic viruses is 
      necessary for the early warning of potential emerging infectious diseases. Here, 
      we report the first surveillance of bat viruses in Macau. In this study, we 
      collected 1004 samples involving 10 bat species from 7 sites from April 2015 to 
      May 2016, and examined the presence of viruses using nucleic acid-based methods. 
      Coronaviruses, adenoviruses and paramyxoviruses were detected in these samples, 
      with a high prevalence of coronaviruses. While, none was positive for hepatitis A 
      virus, hepatitis E virus or hantavirus. Co-infections are not common in those bat 
      species, but coronavirus HKU6 and adenovirus can be found commonly occurred in 
      Myotis ricketti.

AB  - Bats are implicated as natural reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic viruses 
      including SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, Rabies and 
      other lyssaviruses. Accordingly, many One Health surveillance and viral discovery 
      programs have focused on bats. In this report we present viral metagenomic data 
      from bats collected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA]. Unbiased high 
      throughput sequencing of fecal samples from 72 bat individuals comprising four 
      species; lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickii), Egyptian tomb bat 
      (Taphozous perforatus), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), and Egyptian 
      fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) revealed molecular evidence of a diverse set of 
      viral families: Picornaviridae (hepatovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus), 
      Reoviridae (rotavirus), Polyomaviridae (polyomavirus), Papillomaviridae 
      (papillomavirus), Astroviridae (astrovirus), Caliciviridae (sapovirus), 
      Coronaviridae (coronavirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus), Paramyxoviridae 
      (paramyxovirus), and unassigned mononegavirales (chuvirus). Additionally, we 
      discovered a bastro-like virus (Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus), with a genomic 
      organization similar to Hepeviridae. However, since it shared homology with 
      Hepeviridae and Astroviridae at ORF1 and in ORF2, respectively, the newly 
      discovered Hepe-Astrovirus may represent a phylogenetic bridge between 
      Hepeviridae and Astroviridae.

AB  - Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which 
      was first reported in southern China in 2017. It can cause severe diarrhea 
      disease in pigs. In order to detect this new emerging virus rapidly and reliably, 
      a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay was established in this study. Specific 
      primers and probe were designed and synthesized based on the conserved region 
      within the N gene of the viral genome. Results showed that the lowest limit of 
      detection was 3.0 × 10(1) copies/μL. This approach was specific for SADS-CoV, and 
      there were no cross-reaction observed against other 15 swine viruses. It was 10 
      times more sensitive than the conventional PCR and gave higher SADS-CoV positive 
      detection rate (70.69%, 123/174) than the conventional PCR (51.15%, 89/174) from 
      clinical samples. These data indicated that the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR 
      assay established here was an effective method with high sensitivity, specificity 
      and reproducibility for faster and more accurate detection and quantification of 
      SADS-CoV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which 
      belongs to beta group of coronavirus, can infect multiple host species and causes 
      severe diseases in humans. Multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest 
      a bat origin. In this study, we describe the detection and full genome 
      characterization of two CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV from two Italian bats, 
      Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii. METHODS: Pool of viscera were tested by a 
      pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Virus isolation was attempted by inoculation in different 
      cell lines. Full genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent platform 
      and phylogenetic trees were performed using IQtree software. Similarity plots of 
      CoV clade c genomes were generated by using SSE v1.2. The three dimensional 
      macromolecular structure (3DMMS) of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S 
      protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank 
      (PDB). RESULTS: Both samples resulted positive to the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR 
      (IT-batCoVs) and their genome organization showed identical pattern of MERS CoV. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic group placed in the Beta2c clade 
      formed by MERS-CoV sequences originating from humans and camels and bat-related 
      sequences from Africa, Italy and China. The comparison of the secondary and 3DMMS 
      of the RBD of IT-batCoVs with MERS, HKU4 and HKU5 bat sequences showed two aa 
      deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD 
      in IT-batCoV and HKU5 RBDs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported two beta CoVs 
      closely related to MERS that were obtained from two bats belonging to two 
      commonly recorded species in Italy (P. kuhlii and H. savii). The analysis of the 
      RBD showed similar structure in IT-batCoVs and HKU5 respect to HKU4 sequences. 
      Since the RBD domain of HKU4 but not HKU5 can bind to the human DPP4 receptor for 
      MERS-CoV, it is possible to suggest also for IT-batCoVs the absence of 
      DPP4-binding potential. More surveillance studies are needed to better 
      investigate the potential intermediate hosts that may play a role in the 
      interspecies transmission of known and currently unknown coronaviruses with 
      particular attention to the S protein and the receptor specificity and binding 
      affinity.

TI  - Alphacoronaviruses Detected in French Bats Are Phylogeographically Linked to 
      Coronaviruses of European Bats.
PG  - 6279-90
LID - 10.3390/v7122937 [doi]
AB  - Bats are a reservoir for a diverse range of viruses, including coronaviruses 
      (CoVs). To determine the presence of CoVs in French bats, fecal samples were 
      collected between July and August of 2014 from four bat species in seven 
      different locations around the city of Bourges in France. We present for the 
      first time the presence of alpha-CoVs in French Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat 
      species with an estimated prevalence of 4.2%. Based on the analysis of a fragment 
      of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, phylogenetic analyses show that 
      alpha-CoVs sequences detected in French bats are closely related to other 
      European bat alpha-CoVs. Phylogeographic analyses of RdRp sequences show that 
      several CoVs strains circulate in European bats: (i) old strains detected that 
      have probably diverged a long time ago and are detected in different bat 
      subspecies; (ii) strains detected in Myotis and Pipistrellus bat species that 
      have more recently diverged. Our findings support previous observations 
      describing the complexity of the detected CoVs in bats worldwide.

TI  - CD26/DPP4 cell-surface expression in bat cells correlates with bat cell 
      susceptibility to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
      infection and evolution of persistent infection.
PG  - e112060

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently isolated 
      betacoronavirus identified as the etiologic agent of a frequently fatal disease 
      in Western Asia, Middle East respiratory syndrome. Attempts to identify the 
      natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV have focused in part on dromedaries. Bats are also 
      suspected to be reservoirs based on frequent detection of other betacoronaviruses 
      in these mammals. For this study, ten distinct cell lines derived from bats of 
      divergent species were exposed to MERS-CoV. Plaque assays, immunofluorescence 
      assays, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that six bat cell lines 
      can be productively infected. We found that the susceptibility or resistance of 
      these bat cell lines directly correlates with the presence or absence of cell 
      surface-expressed CD26/DPP4, the functional human receptor for MERS-CoV. Human 
      anti-CD26/DPP4 antibodies inhibited infection of susceptible bat cells in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of human CD26/DPP4 receptor conferred 
      MERS-CoV susceptibility to resistant bat cell lines. Finally, sequential passage 
      of MERS-CoV in permissive bat cells established persistent infection with 
      concomitant downregulation of CD26/DPP4 surface expression. Together, these 
      results imply that bats indeed could be among the MERS-CoV host spectrum, and 
      that cellular restriction of MERS-CoV is determined by CD26/DPP4 expression 
      rather than by downstream restriction factors.

TI  - Receptor Usage of a Novel Bat Lineage C Betacoronavirus Reveals Evolution of 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus Spike Proteins for Human 
      Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Binding.
PG  - 197-207
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiy018 [doi]
AB  - Although bats are known to harbor Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV)-related viruses, the role of bats in the evolutionary origin and 
      pathway remains obscure. We identified a novel MERS-CoV-related betacoronavirus, 
      Hp-BatCoV HKU25, from Chinese pipistrelle bats. Although it is closely related to 
      MERS-CoV in most genome regions, its spike protein occupies a phylogenetic 
      position between that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5. Because Ty-BatCoV 
      HKU4 but not Pi-BatCoV HKU5 can use the MERS-CoV receptor human dipeptidyl 
      peptidase 4 (hDPP4) for cell entry, we tested the ability of Hp-BatCoV HKU25 to 
      bind and use hDPP4. The HKU25-receptor binding domain (RBD) can bind to hDPP4 
      protein and hDPP4-expressing cells, but it does so with lower efficiency than 
      that of MERS-RBD. Pseudovirus assays showed that HKU25-spike can use hDPP4 for 
      entry to hDPP4-expressing cells, although with lower efficiency than that of 
      MERS-spike and HKU4-spike. Our findings support a bat origin of MERS-CoV and 
      suggest that bat CoV spike proteins may have evolved in a stepwise manner for 
      binding to hDPP4.

TI  - The Coronavirus Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Evades the Type I Interferon 
      Response through IRE1α-Mediated Manipulation of the MicroRNA miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3 
      Axis.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00728-18 [doi]
LID - e00728-18
AB  - In host innate immunity, type I interferons (IFN-I) are major antiviral 
      molecules, and coronaviruses have evolved diverse strategies to counter the IFN-I 
      response during infection. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member 
      of the Alphacoronavirus family, induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 
      significant IFN-I production after infection. However, how TGEV evades the IFN-I 
      antiviral response despite the marked induction of endogenous IFN-I has remained 
      unclear. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), a highly conserved ER stress 
      sensor with both kinase and RNase activities, is involved in the IFN response. In 
      this study, IRE1α facilitated TGEV replication via downmodulating the host 
      microRNA (miR) miR-30a-5p abundance. miR-30a-5p normally enhances IFN-I antiviral 
      activity by directly targeting the negative regulators of Janus family kinase 
      (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), the suppressor of 
      cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1), and SOCS3. Furthermore, TGEV infection 
      increased SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, which dampened the IFN-I antiviral response 
      and facilitated TGEV replication. Importantly, compared with mock infection, TGEV 
      infection in vivo resulted in decreased miR-30a-5p levels and significantly 
      elevated SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in the piglet ileum. Taken together, our data 
      reveal a new strategy used by TGEV to escape the IFN-I response by engaging the 
      IRE1α-miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3 axis, thus improving our understanding of how TGEV 
      escapes host innate immune defenses.IMPORTANCE Type I interferons (IFN-I) play 
      essential roles in restricting viral infections. Coronavirus infection induces ER 
      stress and the interferon response, which reflects different adaptive cellular 
      processes. An understanding of how coronavirus-elicited ER stress is actively 
      involved in viral replication and manipulates the host IFN-I response has 
      remained elusive. Here, TGEV inhibited host miR-30a-5p via the ER stress sensor 
      IRE1α, which led to the increased expression of negative regulators of JAK-STAT 
      signaling cascades, namely, SOCS1 and SOCS3. Increased SOCS1 or SOCS3 expression 
      impaired the IFN-I antiviral response, promoting TGEV replication. These findings 
      enhance our understanding of the strategies used by coronaviruses to antagonize 
      IFN-I innate immunity via IRE1α-mediated manipulation of the miR-30a-5p/SOCS 
      axis, highlighting the crucial role of IRE1α in innate antiviral resistance and 
      the potential of IRE1α as a novel target against coronavirus infection.

TI  - Glass Wool Concentration Optimization for the Detection of Enveloped and 
      Non-enveloped Waterborne Viruses.
PG  - 184-192
LID - 10.1007/s12560-019-09378-0 [doi]
AB  - An extremely affordable virus concentration method based on adsorption-elution to 
      glass wool and subsequent reconcentration through polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) 
      precipitation was optimized to recover not only non-enveloped viruses but also 
      enveloped viruses. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and transmissible gastroenteritis 
      virus (TGEV) were employed as surrogates for naked and enveloped viruses, 
      respectively, to set up the methodology. Initial experimentation in small-volume 
      samples showed that both types of particles readily adsorbed to the positively 
      charged glass wool but were poorly detached from it through standard elution with 
      0.05 M glycine with 3% of beef extract buffer, pH 9.5, with elution efficiencies 
      of 7.2% and 2.6%, for HAV and TGEV, respectively. To improve the recovery of 
      enveloped viruses, several modifications in the elution were assayed: increasing 
      the elution pH, extending glass wool and eluent contact time, adding a detergent, 
      or performing the elution by recirculation or under agitation. Considering 
      practicability and performance, recircularization of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 
      20 min was the elution procedure of choice, with efficiencies of 25.7% and 18.8% 
      for HAV and TGEV in 50 L of water. Additionally, employing 20% PEG instead of 10% 
      for virus reconcentration improved recoveries up to 47% and 51%, respectively. 
      The optimized procedure was applied to detect naturally occurring HAV and 
      coronaviruses in surface water of Wadi Hanifa, Riyadh. HAV was detected in 38% of 
      the samples, while one sample was positive for an alphacoronavirus. This cheap 
      virus detection system enables the comprehensive surveillance of viruses present 
      in water samples.

AB  - Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a Betacoronavirus recently associated clinically and 
      epidemiologically with emerging outbreaks of pyrogenic, enteric, and/or 
      neurologic disease in horses in the United States, Japan, and Europe. We describe 
      the pathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular findings in 2 
      horses and 1 donkey that succumbed to natural infection with ECoV. One horse and 
      the donkey (case Nos. 1, 3) had severe diffuse necrotizing enteritis with marked 
      villous attenuation, epithelial cell necrosis at the tips of the villi, 
      neutrophilic and fibrinous extravasation into the small intestinal lumen 
      (pseudomembrane formation), as well as crypt necrosis, microthrombosis, and 
      hemorrhage. The other horse (case No. 2) had hyperammonemic encephalopathy with 
      Alzheimer type II astrocytosis throughout the cerebral cortex. ECoV was detected 
      by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in small intestinal tissue, contents, 
      and/or feces, and coronavirus antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in the 
      small intestine in all cases. Coronavirus-like particles characterized by 
      spherical, moderately electron lucent, enveloped virions with distinct 
      peplomer-like structures projecting from the surface were detected by negatively 
      stained transmission electron microscopy in small intestine in case No. 1, and 
      transmission electron microscopy of fixed small intestinal tissue from the same 
      case revealed similar 85- to 100-nm intracytoplasmic particles located in 
      vacuoles and free in the cytoplasm of unidentified (presumably epithelial) cells. 
      Sequence comparison showed 97.9% to 99.0% sequence identity with the ECoV-NC99 
      and Tokachi09 strains. All together, these results indicate that ECoV is 
      associated with necrotizing enteritis and hyperammonemic encephalopathy in 
      equids.

TI  - Identification and Comparison of Receptor Binding Characteristics of the Spike 
      Protein of Two Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strains.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.3390/v8030055 [doi]
LID - 55
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Alphacoronavirus, has caused 
      huge economic losses for the global pork industry recently. The spike (S) protein 
      mediates PEDV entry into host cells. Herein, we investigated the interactions 
      between the S protein and its receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) or 
      co-receptor sugars. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 domain is bound to 
      pAPN. The prototype strain demonstrated similar receptor-binding activity 
      compared with the variant field isolate. Three loops at the tips of the β-barrel 
      domains did not play crucial roles in the PEDV S-pAPN association, indicating 
      that PEDV conforms to a different receptor recognition model compared with 
      transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), and 
      human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEDV S1 
      domain could bind sugar, a possible co-receptor for PEDV. The prototype strain 
      exhibited weaker sugar-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. 
      Strategies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) may be helpful for 
      developing vaccines or antiviral drugs for PEDV. Understanding the differences in 
      receptor binding between the prototype and the variant strains may provide 
      insight into PEDV pathogenesis.

TI  - Discovery of Novel Bat Coronaviruses in South China That Use the Same Receptor as 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00116-18 [doi]
LID - e00116-18
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has represented a human 
      health threat since 2012. Although several MERS-related CoVs that belong to the 
      same species as MERS-CoV have been identified from bats, they do not use the 
      MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we screened 1,059 bat 
      samples from at least 30 bat species collected in different regions in south 
      China and identified 89 strains of lineage C betacoronaviruses, including 
      Tylonycteris pachypus coronavirus HKU4, Pipistrellus pipistrelluscoronavirus 
      HKU5, and MERS-related CoVs. We sequenced the full-length genomes of two positive 
      samples collected from the great evening bat, Ia io, from Guangdong Province. The 
      two genomes were highly similar and exhibited genomic structures identical to 
      those of other lineage C betacoronaviruses. While they exhibited genome-wide 
      nucleotide identities of only 75.3 to 81.2% with other MERS-related CoVs, their 
      gene-coding regions were highly similar to their counterparts, except in the case 
      of the spike proteins. Further protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated 
      that the spike proteins of these MERS-related CoVs bind to the receptor DPP4. 
      Recombination analysis suggested that the newly discovered MERS-related CoVs have 
      acquired their spike genes from a DPP4-recognizing bat coronavirus HKU4. Our 
      study provides further evidence that bats represent the evolutionary origins of 
      MERS-CoV.IMPORTANCE Previous studies suggested that MERS-CoV originated in bats. 
      However, its evolutionary path from bats to humans remains unclear. In this 
      study, we discovered 89 novel lineage C betacoronaviruses in eight bat species. 
      We provide evidence of a MERS-related CoV derived from the great evening bat that 
      uses the same host receptor as human MERS-CoV. This virus also provides evidence 
      for a natural recombination event between the bat MERS-related CoV and another 
      bat coronavirus, HKU4. Our study expands the host ranges of MERS-related CoV and 
      represents an important step toward establishing bats as the natural reservoir of 
      MERS-CoV. These findings may lead to improved epidemiological surveillance of 
      MERS-CoV and the prevention and control of the spread of MERS-CoV to humans.

AB  - Recently several infectious agents with a zoonotic potential have been detected 
      in different bat species. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the 
      transmission dynamics within and between bat species, as well as from bats to 
      other mammals. To better understand these processes, it is important to compare 
      the phylogenetic relationships between different agents to that of their 
      respective hosts. In this study, we analysed more than 950 urine, faeces and oral 
      swab samples collected from 653 bats from mainly four species (Myotis nattereri, 
      Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) for the presence of 
      coronavirus, paramyxovirus and astrovirus related nucleic acids located in three 
      different regions of Germany. Using hemi-nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR 
      amplification of fragments within the highly conserved regions of the respective 
      RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, we detected astrovirus sequences at an 
      overall detection rate of 25.8% of the analysed animals, with a maximum of 65% in 
      local populations. The detection rates for coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were 
      distinctly lower, ranging between 1.4% and 3.1%. Interestingly, the sequence 
      similarities in samples collected from the same bat species in different 
      geographical areas were distinctly larger than the sequence similarities between 
      samples from different species sampled at the same location. This indicates that 
      host specificity may be more important than host ecology for the presence of 
      certain viruses in bats.

TI  - Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like, Middle East Respiratory 
      Syndrome-Like Bat Coronaviruses and Group H Rotavirus in Faeces of Korean Bats.
PG  - 365-72
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12515 [doi]
AB  - Bat species around the world have recently been recognized as major reservoirs of 
      several zoonotic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah virus 
      and Hendra virus. In this study, consensus primer-based reverse transcriptase 
      polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) and high-throughput sequencing were 
      performed to investigate viruses in bat faecal samples collected at 11 natural 
      bat habitat sites from July to December 2015 in Korea. Diverse coronaviruses were 
      first detected in Korean bat faeces, including alphacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-like 
      and MERS-CoV-like betacoronaviruses. In addition, we identified a novel bat 
      rotavirus belonging to group H rotavirus which has only been described in human 
      and pigs until now. Therefore, our results suggest the need for continuing 
      surveillance and additional virological studies in domestic bat.

TI  - Dampened NLRP3-mediated inflammation in bats and implications for a special viral 
      reservoir host.

AB  - Bats are special in their ability to host emerging viruses. As the only flying 
      mammal, bats endure high metabolic rates yet exhibit elongated lifespans. It is 
      currently unclear whether these unique features are interlinked. The important 
      inflammasome sensor, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), has been 
      linked to both viral-induced and age-related inflammation. Here, we report 
      significantly dampened activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bat primary immune 
      cells compared to human or mouse counterparts. Lower induction of 
      apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation 
      and secretion of interleukin-1β in response to both 'sterile' stimuli and 
      infection with multiple zoonotic viruses including influenza A virus 
      (-single-stranded (ss) RNA), Melaka virus (PRV3M, double-stranded RNA) and Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (+ssRNA) was observed. Importantly, this 
      reduction of inflammation had no impact on the overall viral loads. We identified 
      dampened transcriptional priming, a novel splice variant and an altered 
      leucine-rich repeat domain of bat NLRP3 as the cause. Our results elucidate an 
      important mechanism through which bats dampen inflammation with implications for 
      longevity and unique viral reservoir status.

TI  - Molecular survey of RNA viruses in Hungarian bats: discovering novel 
      astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses.
PG  - 846-55
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2014.1637 [doi]
AB  - Background: Bat-borne viruses pose a potential risk to human health and are the 
      focus of increasing scientific interest. To start gaining information about 
      bat-transmitted viruses in Hungary, we tested multiple bat species for several 
      virus groups between 2012 and 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were 
      collected from bats across Hungary. We performed group-specific RT-PCR screening 
      for astro-, calici-, corona-, lyssa-, othoreo-, paramyxo-, and rotaviruses. 
      Positive samples were selected and sequenced for further phylogenetic analyses. 
      RESULTS: A total of 447 fecal samples, representing 24 European bat species were 
      tested. Novel strains of astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses were 
      detected and analyzed phylogenetically. Out of the 447 tested samples, 40 (9%) 
      bats were positive for at least one virus. Bat-transmitted astroviruses (BtAstV) 
      were detected in eight species with a 6.93% detection rate (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 4.854, 9.571). Coronaviruses (BtCoV) were detected in seven bat 
      species with a detection rate of 1.79% (95% CI 0.849, 3.348), whereas novel 
      caliciviruses (BtCalV) were detected in three bat species with a detection rate 
      of 0.67% (95% CI 0.189, 1.780). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a great diversity 
      among astrovirus strains, whereas the Hungarian BtCoV strains clustered together 
      with both alpha- and betacoronavirus strains from other European countries. One 
      of the most intriguing findings of our investigation is the discovery of novel 
      BtCalVs in Europe. The Hungarian BtCalV did not cluster with any of the 
      calcivirus genera identified in the family so far. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      successfully confirmed BtCoVs in numerous bat species. Furthermore, we have 
      described new bat species harboring BtAstVs in Europe and found new species of 
      CalVs. Further long-term investigations involving more species are needed in the 
      Central European region for a better understanding on the host specificity, 
      seasonality, phylogenetic relationships, and the possible zoonotic potential of 
      these newly described viruses.

      Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Austria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a syndrome that is characterized 
      by rapidly spreading watery diarrhea affecting pigs of all ages, but with major 
      effects on suckling piglets. The disease, as well as the causative 
      Alphacoronavirus, the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was first described 
      in Europe in the 1970s and since then has spread over many Asian and American 
      countries, where it recently led to devastating effects on swine health and pork 
      industry. While the disease was seldom reported in Europe within the last few 
      decades, a few recent reports re-emergence of PED in German pig farms. The 
      hitherto isolated German strain seems to be closely related to a low pathogenic 
      PEDV variant from the USA. This case report describes the first detection of PEDV 
      in Austria. CASE PRESENTATION: Reduced feed uptake and occasional diarrhea were 
      observed in December 2014 in a group of fattening pigs, kept on an Austrian swine 
      farm. The concerned pigs had been recently purchased from Germany. Within a few 
      weeks, diarrhea became apparent also in pigs of Austrian origin, which were kept 
      in a different stable on the same farm. Gastrointestinal symptoms among fattening 
      pigs were generally mild, quickly resolving and did not lead to death. PEDV RNA 
      was identified by RT-qPCR in pooled feces and serum and PEDV antibodies were 
      detectable in serum in both groups of pigs. Phylogenetic analysis of the nearly 
      complete PEDV spike gene shows that the Austrian PEDV strain is highly similar to 
      other strains involved in recent outbreaks in Western and Central Europe. 
      CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the presence of PEDV in 
      Austria. The virus was probably introduced by purchasing piglets from a German 
      source, which underlines the significance of trans-boundary animal trade for the 
      distribution of highly contagious diseases, such as PED.

AB  - Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which 
      was associated with severe diarrhea disease in pigs. SADS-CoV was first detected 
      and identified as the causative agent of a devastating swine disease outbreak in 
      southern China in 2017. Routine monitoring and early detection of the source of 
      infection is therefore integral to the prevention and control of SADS-CoV 
      infection. In this study, a SYBR green-based real-time reverse transcription 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique was established for 
      rapid detection and monitoring of this emerging virus. Specific primers were 
      designed based on the conserved region within the M gene of the viral genome. The 
      lowest detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay was 10 copies/μL. This assay was 
      specific and had no cross-reaction with other 11 swine viruses. The positive rate 
      of 84 clinical samples for the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and the conventional 
      RT-PCR was 73.81% (62/84) and 53.57% (45/84), respectively. These results 
      demonstrated that the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR technique was an effectively 
      diagnostic method with higher sensitivity than probe-based RT-qPCR and gel-based 
      RT-PCR for detection and epidemiological investigations of SADS-CoV.

TI  - Evaluation of equine coronavirus fecal shedding among hospitalized horses.
PG  - 918-922
LID - 10.1111/jvim.15449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, diagnosis of equine coronavirus (ECoV) relies on the 
      exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease along with molecular 
      detection of ECoV in feces or tissue. Although this approach is complete, it is 
      costly and may not always be achievable. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the 
      overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low. Our objective was 
      to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal 
      disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral 
      hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. ANIMALS: 
      One-hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the Washington State University 
      Veterinary Teaching Hospital for gastrointestinal disease (n = 65) or for imaging 
      under anesthesia (n = 65) that were hospitalized for 48 hours. Owner consent was 
      obtained before sampling. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 
      48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy 
      (EM) were performed on all samples. RESULTS: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was 
      PCR-positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV-like particles in 9 of 
      258 samples, parvovirus-like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus-like 
      particles in 1 of 258 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence 
      of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that 
      are PCR-positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent 
      with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical 
      relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated.

TI  - Potent MERS-CoV Fusion Inhibitory Peptides Identified from HR2 Domain in Spike 
      Protein of Bat Coronavirus HKU4.
LID - 10.3390/v11010056 [doi]
LID - 56
AB  - The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 and 
      caused continual outbreaks worldwide with high mortality. However, no effective 
      anti-MERS-CoV drug is currently available. Recently, numerous evolutionary 
      studies have suggested that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronavirus (BatCoV). We 
      herein reported that three peptides derived from the HR2 region in spike protein 
      of BatCoV HKU4, including HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, could bind the 
      MERS-CoV HR1-derived peptide to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) with high 
      stability. Moreover, these peptides, particularly HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, 
      exhibited potent inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell⁻cell fusion 
      and viral infection, suggesting that these HKU4 HR2-derived peptides could be 
      candidates for futher development as antiviral agents against MERS-CoV infection.

TI  - Identification of the Fusion Peptide-Containing Region in Betacoronavirus Spike 
      Glycoproteins.
PG  - 5586-5600
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00015-16 [doi]
AB  - The fusion peptides (FP) play an essential role in fusion of viral envelope with 
      cellular membranes. The location and properties of the FPs in the spike (S) 
      glycoproteins of different coronaviruses (CoV) have not yet been determined. 
      Through amino acid sequence analysis of S proteins of representative CoVs, we 
      identified a common region as a possible FP (pFP) that shares the characteristics 
      of FPs of class I viral fusion proteins, including high Ala/Gly content, 
      intermediate hydrophobicity, and few charged residues. To test the hypothesis 
      that this region contains the CoV FP, we systemically mutated every residue in 
      the pFP of Middle East respiratory syndrome betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) and found 
      that 11 of the 22 residues in the pFP (from G953 to L964, except for A956) were 
      essential for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. The synthetic 
      MERS-CoV pFP core peptide (955IAGVGWTAGL964) induced extensive fusion of liposome 
      membranes, while mutant peptide failed to induce any lipid mixing. We also 
      selectively mutated residues in pFPs of two other β-CoVs, severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). 
      Although the amino acid sequences of these two pFPs differed significantly from 
      that of MERS-CoV and each other, most of the pFP mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV also 
      failed to mediate membrane fusion, suggesting that these pFPs are also the 
      functional FPs. Thus, the FPs of 3 different lineages of β-CoVs are conserved in 
      location within the S glycoproteins and in their functions, although their amino 
      acid sequences have diverged significantly during CoV evolution. IMPORTANCE: 
      Within the class I viral fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses, the FP is the 
      critical mediator of fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes 
      leading to virus infection. FPs from within a virus family, like influenza 
      viruses or human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), tend to share high amino acid 
      sequence identity. In this study, we determined the location and amino acid 
      sequences of the FPs of S glycoproteins of 3 β-CoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MHV, 
      and demonstrated that they were essential for mediating cell-cell fusion and 
      virus entry. Interestingly, in marked contrast to the FPs of influenza and HIV, 
      the primary amino acid sequences of the FPs of β-CoVs in 3 different lineages 
      differed significantly. Thus, during evolution the FPs of β-CoVs have diverged 
      significantly in their primary sequences while maintaining the same essential 
      biological functions. Our findings identify a potential new target for 
      development of drugs against CoVs.

AB  - The prevalence of organisms known to be associated with bovine respiratory 
      disease (BRD) was investigated in cattle prior to export. A quantitative reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect nucleic acids 
      from the following viruses and bacteria in nasal swab samples: Bovine coronavirus 
      (BoCV; Betacoronavirus 1), Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), Bovine viral diarrhea 
      virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), Bovine parainfluenza 
      virus 3 (BPIV-3), Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, 
      and Pasteurella multocida. Between 2010 and 2012, nasal swabs were collected from 
      1,484 apparently healthy cattle destined for export to the Middle East and 
      Russian Federation. In addition, whole blood samples from 334 animals were tested 
      for antibodies to BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV-1, and BPIV-3 using enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. The nasal prevalence of BoCV at the individual animal level 
      was 40.1%. The nasal and seroprevalence of BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV-1, and BPIV-3 was 
      1.0% and 39%, 1.2% and 46%, 3.0% and 56%, and 1.4% and 87%, respectively. The 
      nasal prevalence of H. somni, M. bovis, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida was 42%, 
      4.8%, 13.4%, and 26%, respectively. Significant differences in nasal and 
      seroprevalence were detected between groups of animals from different 
      geographical locations. The results of the current study provide baseline data on 
      the prevalence of organisms associated with BRD in Australian live export cattle 
      in the preassembly period. This data could be used to develop strategies for BRD 
      prevention and control prior to loading.

TI  - Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus Activation of the Integrin 
      α5β1-FAK-Cofilin Pathway Causes Cytoskeletal Rearrangement To Promote Its 
      Invasion of N2a Cells.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01736-18 [doi]
LID - e01736-18
AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurotropic 
      virus that causes diffuse neuronal infection with neurological damage and high 
      mortality. Virus-induced cytoskeletal dynamics are thought to be closely related 
      to this type of nerve damage. Currently, the regulation pattern of the actin 
      cytoskeleton and its molecular mechanism remain unclear when PHEV enters the host 
      cells. Here, we demonstrate that entry of PHEV into N2a cells induces a biphasic 
      remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and a dynamic change in cofilin activity. 
      Viral entry is affected by the disruption of actin kinetics or alteration of 
      cofilin activity. PHEV binds to integrin α5β1 and then initiates the integrin 
      α5β1-FAK signaling pathway, leading to virus-induced early cofilin 
      phosphorylation and F-actin polymerization. Additionally, Ras-related C3 
      botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and 
      downstream regulatory gene p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs) are recruited as 
      downstream mediators of PHEV-induced dynamic changes of the cofilin activity 
      pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PHEV utilizes the integrin 
      α5β1-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK-cofilin pathway to cause an actin cytoskeletal 
      rearrangement to promote its own invasion, providing theoretical support for the 
      development of PHEV pathogenic mechanisms and new antiviral targets.IMPORTANCE 
      PHEV, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a typical neurotropic virus that 
      primarily affects the nervous system of piglets to produce typical neurological 
      symptoms. However, the mechanism of nerve damage caused by the virus has not been 
      fully elucidated. Actin is an important component of the cytoskeleton of 
      eukaryotic cells and serves as the first obstacle to the entry of pathogens into 
      host cells. Additionally, the morphological structure and function of nerve cells 
      depend on the dynamic regulation of the actin skeleton. Therefore, exploring the 
      mechanism of neuronal injury induced by PHEV from the perspective of the actin 
      cytoskeleton not only helps elucidate the pathogenesis of PHEV but also provides 
      a theoretical basis for the search for new antiviral targets. This is the first 
      report to define a mechanistic link between alterations in signaling from 
      cytoskeleton pathways and the mechanism of PHEV invading nerve cells.

AB  - Emergent and preemergent coronaviruses (CoVs) pose a global threat that requires 
      immediate intervention. Rapid intervention necessitates the capacity to generate, 
      grow, and genetically manipulate infectious CoVs in order to rapidly evaluate 
      pathogenic mechanisms, host and tissue permissibility, and candidate antiviral 
      therapeutic efficacy. CoVs encode the largest viral RNA genomes at about 
      28-32,000 nucleotides in length, and thereby complicate efficient engineering of 
      the genome. Deconstructing the genome into manageable fragments affords the 
      plasticity necessary to rapidly introduce targeted genetic changes in parallel 
      and assort mutated fragments while maximizing genome stability over time. In this 
      protocol we describe a well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy for CoVs 
      that is comprised of partitioning the viral genome into 5-7 independent DNA 
      fragments (depending on the CoV genome), each subcloned into a plasmid for 
      increased stability and ease of genetic manipulation and amplification. 
      Coronavirus genomes are conveniently partitioned by introducing type IIS or IIG 
      restriction enzyme recognition sites that confer directional cloning. Since each 
      restriction site leaves a unique overhang between adjoining fragments, 
      reconstruction of the full-length genome can be achieved through a standard DNA 
      ligation comprised of equal molar ratios of each fragment. Using this method, 
      recombinant CoVs can be rapidly generated and used to investigate host range, 
      gene function, pathogenesis, and candidate therapeutics for emerging and 
      preemergent CoVs both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that infects pigs and can 
      have mortality rates approaching 100% in piglets, causing serious economic 
      impact. The 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for the coronaviral life 
      cycle and is an appealing target for the development of therapeutics. We report 
      the expression, purification, crystallization and 2.10 Å X-ray structure of 
      3CL(pro) from PEDV. Analysis of the PEDV 3CL(pro) structure and comparison to 
      other coronaviral 3CL(pro)'s from the same alpha-coronavirus phylogeny shows that 
      the overall structures and active site architectures across 3CL(pro)'s are 
      conserved, with the exception of a loop that comprises the protease S2 pocket. We 
      found a known inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV) 3CL(pro), (R)-16, to have inhibitor activity against PEDV 3CL(pro), 
      despite that SARS-3CL(pro) and PEDV 3CL(pro) share only 45.4% sequence identity. 
      Structural comparison reveals that the majority of residues involved in (R)-16 
      binding to SARS-3CL(pro) are conserved in PEDV-3CL(pro); however, the sequence 
      variation and positional difference in the loop forming the S2 pocket may account 
      for large observed difference in IC50 values. This work advances our 
      understanding of the subtle, but important, differences in coronaviral 3CL(pro) 
      architecture and contributes to the broader structural knowledge of coronaviral 
      3CL(pro)'s.

AB  - A molecular survey for traditional and emerging pathogens associated with canine 
      infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) was conducted in Italy between 2011 and 
      2013 on a total of 138 dogs, including 78 early acute clinically ill CIRD 
      animals, 22 non-clinical but exposed to clinically ill CIRD dogs and 38 CIRD 
      convalescent dogs. The results showed that canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) was 
      the most commonly detected CIRD pathogen, followed by canine respiratory 
      coronavirus (CRCoV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma cynos, Mycoplasma 
      canis and canine pneumovirus (CnPnV). Some classical CIRD agents, such as canine 
      adenoviruses, canine distemper virus and canid herpesvirus 1, were not detected 
      at all, as were not other emerging respiratory viruses (canine influenza virus, 
      canine hepacivirus) and bacteria (Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus). Most 
      severe forms of respiratory disease were observed in the presence of CPIV, CRCoV 
      and M. cynos alone or in combination with other pathogens, whereas single CnPnV 
      or M. canis infections were detected in dogs with no or very mild respiratory 
      signs. Interestingly, only the association of M. cynos (alone or in combination 
      with either CRCoV or M. canis) with severe clinical forms was statistically 
      significant. The study, while confirming CPIV as the main responsible for CIRD 
      occurrence, highlights the increasing role of recently discovered viruses, such 
      as CRCoV and CnPnV, for which effective vaccines are not available in the market.

AB  - The threat of a major coronavirus pandemic urges the development of strategies to 
      combat these pathogens. Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is an α-coronavirus 
      that can cause severe lower-respiratory-tract infections requiring 
      hospitalization. We report here the 3.4-Å-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of 
      the HCoV-NL63 coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer, which mediates entry into 
      host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. 
      The map resolves the extensive glycan shield obstructing the protein surface and, 
      in combination with mass spectrometry, provides a structural framework to 
      understand the accessibility to antibodies. The structure reveals the complete 
      architecture of the fusion machinery including the triggering loop and the 
      C-terminal domains, which contribute to anchoring the trimer to the viral 
      membrane. Our data further suggest that HCoV-NL63 and other coronaviruses use 
      molecular trickery, based on epitope masking with glycans and activating 
      conformational changes, to evade the immune system of infected hosts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 
      in North America, Asia and Europe has caused severe economic loss to the global 
      swine industry. However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on 
      disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have 
      made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites 
      for any host. METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA 
      virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach 
      based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal 
      swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed 
      the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus 
      genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), 
      Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), 
      Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and 
      Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV 
      infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an 
      extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, 
      Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.

      coronaviruses.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) originated in bats and 
      spread to humans via zoonotic transmission from camels. We analyzed the evolution 
      of the spike (S) gene in betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) isolated from different 
      mammals, in bat coronavirus populations, as well as in MERS-CoV strains from the 
      current outbreak. Results indicated several positively selected sites located in 
      the region comprising the two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and their linker. Two 
      sites (R652 and V1060) were positively selected in the betaCoVs phylogeny and 
      correspond to mutations associated with expanded host range in other 
      coronaviruses. During the most recent evolution of MERS-CoV, adaptive mutations 
      in the HR1 (Q/R/H1020) arose in camels or in a previous host and spread to 
      humans. We determined that different residues at position 1020 establish distinct 
      inter- and intra-helical interactions and affect the stability of the six-helix 
      bundle formed by the HRs. A similar effect on stability was observed for a nearby 
      mutation (T1015N) that increases MERS-CoV infection efficiency in vitro. Data 
      herein indicate that the heptad repeat region was a major target of adaptive 
      evolution in MERS-CoV-related viruses; these results are relevant for the design 
      of fusion inhibitor peptides with antiviral function.

LID - e01628-17
AB  - Coronaviruses recently emerged as major human pathogens causing outbreaks of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. They 
      utilize the spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral envelope to mediate host 
      attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection. 
      The S protein is a major determinant of the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses 
      and is also the main target of the host humoral immune response. We report here 
      the 3.5-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S glycoprotein 
      trimer from the pathogenic porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), which belongs to the 
      recently identified Deltacoronavirus genus. Structural and glycoproteomics data 
      indicate that the glycans of PDCoV S are topologically conserved compared with 
      the human respiratory coronavirus NL63 S, resulting in similar surface areas 
      being shielded from neutralizing antibodies and implying that both viruses are 
      under comparable immune pressure in their respective hosts. The structure further 
      reveals a shortened S(2)' activation loop, containing a reduced number of basic 
      amino acids, which participates in rendering the spike largely protease 
      resistant. This property distinguishes PDCoV S from recently characterized 
      betacoronavirus S proteins and suggests that the S protein of enterotropic PDCoV 
      has evolved to tolerate the protease-rich environment of the small intestine and 
      to fine-tune its fusion activation to avoid premature triggering and reduction of 
      infectivity.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses use transmembrane S glycoprotein trimers to 
      promote host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We 
      determined a near-atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S 
      ectodomain trimer from the pathogenic PDCoV, which is responsible for diarrhea in 
      piglets and has had devastating consequences for the swine industry worldwide. 
      Structural and glycoproteomics data reveal that PDCoV S is decorated with 78 
      N-linked glycans obstructing the protein surface to limit accessibility to 
      neutralizing antibodies in a way reminiscent of what has recently been described 
      for a human respiratory coronavirus. PDCoV S is largely protease resistant, which 
      distinguishes it from most other characterized coronavirus S glycoproteins and 
      suggests that enteric coronaviruses have evolved to fine-tune fusion activation 
      in the protease-rich environment of the small intestine of infected hosts.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been detected worldwide in several bat species, which 
      are considered the main reservoir. The attention to the high diversity of CoVs 
      hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of 
      human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that 
      cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains 
      (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to 
      severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. 
      Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive 
      correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs 
      is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, 
      increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this 
      study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus 
      kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and 
      characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the 
      Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV 
      molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The 
      analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the 
      correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat 
      Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in 
      European countries.

AB  - This is the first country-wide surveillance of bat-borne viruses in Kenya 
      spanning from 2012-2015 covering sites perceived to have medium to high level 
      bat-human interaction. The objective of this surveillance study was to apply a 
      non-invasive approach using fresh feces to detect viruses circulating within the 
      diverse species of Kenyan bats. We screened for both DNA and RNA viruses; 
      specifically, astroviruses (AstVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), caliciviruses (CalVs), 
      coronaviruses (CoVs), flaviviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses (PMVs), 
      polyomaviruses (PYVs) and rotaviruses. We used family-specific primers, amplicon 
      sequencing and further characterization by phylogenetic analysis. Except for 
      filoviruses, eight virus families were detected with varying distributions and 
      positive rates across the five regions (former provinces) studied. AstVs 
      (12.83%), CoVs (3.97%), PMV (2.4%), ADV (2.26%), PYV (1.65%), CalVs (0.29%), 
      rotavirus (0.19%) and flavivirus (0.19%). Novel CalVs were detected in Rousettus 
      aegyptiacus and Mops condylurus while novel Rotavirus-A-related viruses were 
      detected in Taphozous bats and R. aegyptiacus. The two Rotavirus A (RVA) strains 
      detected were highly related to human strains with VP6 genotypes I2 and I16. 
      Genotype I16 has previously been assigned to human RVA-strain B10 from Kenya 
      only, which raises public health concern, particularly considering increased 
      human-bat interaction. Additionally, 229E-like bat CoVs were detected in samples 
      originating from Hipposideros bats roosting in sites with high human activity. 
      Our findings confirm the presence of diverse viruses in Kenyan bats while 
      providing extended knowledge on bat virus distribution. The detection of viruses 
      highly related to human strains and hence of public health concern, underscores 
      the importance of continuous surveillance.

TI  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus ORF8 Protein Is Acquired 
      from SARS-Related Coronavirus from Greater Horseshoe Bats through Recombination.
PG  - 10532-47
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01048-15 [doi]
AB  - Despite the identification of horseshoe bats as the reservoir of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), the origin of 
      SARS-CoV ORF8, which contains the 29-nucleotide signature deletion among human 
      strains, remains obscure. Although two SARS-related Rhinolophus sinicus bat CoVs 
      (SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs) previously detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 
      sinicus) in Yunnan, RsSHC014 and Rs3367, possessed 95% genome identities to human 
      and civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 protein exhibited only 32.2 to 33% amino acid 
      identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. To elucidate the origin of SARS-CoV 
      ORF8, we sampled 348 bats of various species in Yunnan, among which diverse 
      alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, including potentially novel CoVs, were 
      identified, with some showing potential interspecies transmission. The genomes of 
      two betacoronaviruses, SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C, from greater 
      horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), possessed 93% nucleotide identities 
      to human/civet SARSr-CoV genomes. Although these two betacoronaviruses displayed 
      lower similarities than SARSr-Rs-BatCoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367 in S protein to civet 
      SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 proteins demonstrated exceptionally high (80.4 to 81.3%) 
      amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs, compared to 
      SARSr-BatCoVs from other horseshoe bats (23.2 to 37.3%). Potential recombination 
      events were identified around ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, 
      leading to the generation of civet SARSr-CoVs. The expression of ORF8 subgenomic 
      mRNA suggested that the ORF8 protein may be functional in SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs. The 
      high Ka/Ks ratio among human SARS-CoVs compared to that among SARSr-BatCoVs 
      supported that ORF8 is under strong positive selection during animal-to-human 
      transmission. Molecular clock analysis using ORF1ab showed that SARSr-Rf-BatCoV 
      YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C diverged from civet/human SARSr-CoVs in approximately 1990. 
      SARS-CoV ORF8 originated from SARSr-CoVs of greater horseshoe bats through 
      recombination, which may be important for animal-to-human transmission. 
      IMPORTANCE: Although horseshoe bats are the primary reservoir of SARS-related 
      coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), it is still unclear how these bat viruses have 
      evolved to cross the species barrier to infect civets and humans. Most human 
      SARS-CoV epidemic strains contain a signature 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8, 
      compared to civet SARSr-CoVs, suggesting that ORF8 may be important for 
      interspecies transmission. However, the origin of SARS-CoV ORF8 remains obscure. 
      In particular, SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) 
      exhibited <40% amino acid identities to human/civet SARS-CoV in the ORF8 protein. 
      We detected diverse alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses among various bat 
      species in Yunnan, China, including two SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs from greater horseshoe 
      bats that possessed ORF8 proteins with exceptionally high amino acid identities 
      to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. We demonstrated recombination events around 
      ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, leading to the generation of 
      civet SARSr-CoVs. Our findings offer insight into the evolutionary origin of 
      SARS-CoV ORF8 protein, which was likely acquired from SARSr-CoVs of greater 
      horseshoe bats through recombination.

TI  - Interferon Regulatory Factor 3-Mediated Signaling Limits Middle-East Respiratory 
      Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus Propagation in Cells from an Insectivorous Bat.
LID - 10.3390/v11020152 [doi]
LID - 152
AB  - Insectivorous bats are speculated to be ancestral hosts of Middle-East 
      respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV). MERS-CoV causes disease in humans 
      with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human 
      antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not 
      develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate 
      less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to 
      subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus 
      fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in 
      human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta 
      (IFNβ) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a 
      critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in 
      bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of 
      viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by 
      nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 
      activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated 
      that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFNβ in 
      bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus 
      bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious infectious 
      disease which first emerged in late 2002, caused by a then novel human 
      coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The virus is believed to have 
      originated from bats and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such 
      as civet cats. The re-emergence of SARS-CoV remains a valid concern due to the 
      continual persistence of zoonotic SARS-CoVs and SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) in bat 
      reservoirs. In this study, the screening for the presence of SARS-specific T 
      cells in a cohort of three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years 
      post-infection was carried out, and all memory T cell responses detected target 
      the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Two CD8(+) T cell responses targeting the 
      SARS-CoV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were characterized by 
      determining their HLA restriction and minimal T cell epitope regions. 
      Furthermore, these responses were found to persist up to 11 years post-infection. 
      An absence of cross-reactivity of these CD8(+) T cell responses against the 
      newly-emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was also 
      demonstrated. The knowledge of the persistence of SARS-specific celullar immunity 
      targeting the viral structural proteins in SARS-recovered individuals is 
      important in the design and development of SARS vaccines, which are currently 
      unavailable.

TI  - Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Limits Interferon Production by Inducing a Host 
      Shutoff That Requires Accessory Protein 5b.
PG  - 7519-7528
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00627-16 [doi]
AB  - During infection of their host cells, viruses often inhibit the production of 
      host proteins, a process that is referred to as host shutoff. By doing this, 
      viruses limit the production of antiviral proteins and increase production 
      capacity for viral proteins. Coronaviruses from the genera Alphacoronavirus and 
      Betacoronavirus, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV), establish host shutoff via their nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). The 
      Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus genomes, however, do not encode nsp1, and 
      it has been suggested that these viruses do not induce host shutoff. Here, we 
      show that the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) does induce host 
      shutoff, and we find that its accessory protein 5b is indispensable for this 
      function. Importantly, we found that 5b-null viruses, unlike wild-type viruses, 
      induce production of high concentrations of type I interferon protein in vitro, 
      indicating that host shutoff by IBV plays an important role in antagonizing the 
      host's innate immune response. Altogether, we demonstrate that 5b is a functional 
      equivalent of nsp1, thereby answering the longstanding question of whether lack 
      of nsp1 in gammacoronaviruses is compensated for by another viral protein. As 
      such, our study is a significant step forward in the understanding of coronavirus 
      biology and closes a gap in the understanding of some IBV virulence strategies. 
      IMPORTANCE: Many viruses inhibit protein synthesis by their host cell to enhance 
      virus replication and to antagonize antiviral defense mechanisms. This process is 
      referred to as host shutoff. We studied gene expression and protein synthesis in 
      chicken cells infected with the important poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis 
      virus (IBV). We show that IBV inhibits synthesis of host proteins, including that 
      of type I interferon, a key component of the antiviral response. The IBV-induced 
      host shutoff, however, does not require degradation of host RNA. Furthermore, we 
      demonstrate that accessory protein 5b of IBV plays a crucial role in the onset of 
      host shutoff. Our findings suggest that inhibition of host protein synthesis is a 
      common feature of coronaviruses and primarily serves to inhibit the antiviral 
      response of the host.

AB  - Bats have been shown as important mammal resevoirs to carry a variety of zoonotic 
      pathogens. To analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions 
      of China, we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput 
      sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of China. We obtained 
      5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, 
      including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping 
      sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the 
      sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified 
      into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and 
      five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and 
      phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat 
      viruses and some bat viruses closely-related to known human/animal pathogens, 
      including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and 
      circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the 
      viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the 
      transmission of viruses from bats to humans.

TI  - Simultaneous detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East

AB  - Since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) share similar characteristics with respect 
      to clinical signs, etiology, and transmission, methods for a rapid and accurate 
      differential diagnosis are important. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
      develop a duplex real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method for the 
      simultaneous detection of these viruses. Primers and probes that target the 
      conserved spike S2 region of human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs 
      were designed. The results of real-time RT-PCR showed specific reactions for each 
      virus with adequate detection limits of 50-100 copies/mL and 5-100 copies/mL 
      using pUC57-SARS-pS2 (a template for SARS-CoV) and pGEM-MERS-S2 (a template for 
      MERS-CoV), respectively. In addition, this real-time RT-PCR system was able to 
      detect the target viruses SARS-like bat CoV and MERS-CoV in bat fecal samples and 
      sputum of MERS patients, respectively. Therefore, this newly developed real-time 
      RT-PCR method is expected to detect not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans but 
      also several bat CoVs that are closely related to these viruses in bats.

AB  - Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a recently described enteric virus with worldwide 
      outbreaks; however, there are little data available on clinical presentation, 
      diagnosis, and outcome. The study objective was to document case management of 
      ECoV in adult horses presented to a referral hospital and compare to a cohort of 
      horses that tested negative for ECoV. A retrospective case series was performed 
      based on positive real-time quantitative PCR results for ECoV on faeces from 
      horses treated at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1 March 
      2012 to 31 March 2018. Horses negative for ECoV were matched to the ECoV-positive 
      group as controls. Data collected included signalment, history, exam findings, 
      diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up. Thirty-three horses (median age, 11 years; 
      range, 2-37 years) tested ECoV-positive, including three horses with 
      co-infections. Presenting complaints for ECoV-infected horses included historic 
      fevers (n = 25/30; 83%), anorexia (n = 14/30; 47%), and colic (n = 13/30; 43%). 
      ECoV-positive horses had significantly lower white blood cell (median, 
      3.0 × 10(9)/L; range, 0.68-16.2 × 10(9)/L), neutrophil (median, 1.26 × 10(9)/L; 
      range, 0.15-14.4 × 10(9)/L), and lymphocyte (median, 0.86 × 10(9)/L; range, 
      0.42-3.47 × 10(9)/L) counts than ECoV-negative horses. Electrolyte and metabolic 
      derangements and scant faeces were common. Twenty-seven horses were hospitalised 
      for a median of 5 days (range, 0.5-14 days), with 26/27 (96%) horses surviving to 
      discharge. ECoV infection should be a differential diagnosis for adult horses 
      with fever, colic, anorexia, and leukopenia. The disease has a low mortality 
      rate, but horses may require intensive care to resolve severe leukopenia, 
      systemic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances.

TI  - Host cell entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus after two-step, 
      furin-mediated activation of the spike protein.
PG  - 15214-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1407087111 [doi]
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified 
      betacoronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in humans. The coronavirus 
      spike (S) protein is the main determinant of viral entry, and although it was 
      previously shown that MERS-CoV S can be activated by various proteases, the 
      details of the mechanisms of proteolytic activation of fusion are still 
      incompletely characterized. Here, we have uncovered distinctive characteristics 
      of MERS-CoV S. We identify, by bioinformatics and peptide cleavage assays, two 
      cleavage sites for furin, a ubiquitously expressed protease, which are located at 
      the S1/S2 interface and at the S2' position of the S protein. We show that 
      although the S1/S2 site is proteolytically processed by furin during protein 
      biosynthesis, the S2' site is cleaved upon viral entry. MERS-CoV pseudovirion 
      infection was shown to be enhanced by elevated levels of furin expression, and 
      entry could be decreased by furin siRNA silencing. Enhanced furin activity 
      appeared to partially override the low pH-dependent nature of MERS-CoV entry. 
      Inhibition of furin activity was shown to decrease MERS-CoV S-mediated entry, as 
      well as infection by the virus. Overall, we show that MERS-CoV has evolved an 
      unusual two-step furin activation for fusion, suggestive of a role during the 
      process of emergence into the human population. The ability of MERS-CoV to use 
      furin in this manner, along with other proteases, may explain the polytropic 
      nature of the virus.

AB  - Since May 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea have devastated the U.S. 
      swine industry, causing immense economic losses. Two different swine enteric 
      coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Delta coronavirus) have been 
      isolated from the affected swine population. The disease has been reported from 
      at least 32 states of the United States and other countries, including Mexico, 
      Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, and Ukraine, with repeated 
      outbreaks in previously infected herds. Here we report the isolation and 
      characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from diarrheic feces 
      of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal 
      from multiple sources. MRV3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had 
      recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states. Several MRV3 isolates were 
      obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or 
      developing chicken embryos. Biological characterization of two representative 
      isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90°C. NextGen 
      sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the S1 segment 
      to mammalian and bat MRV3. Neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these 
      viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and 
      acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection. Therefore, 
      the novel porcine MRV3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine 
      enteric viruses. The role of MRV3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic 
      diarrhea in the United States remains to be determined, but the pathogenic nature 
      of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence. 
      IMPORTANCE: Porcine orthoreoviruses causing diarrhea have been reported in China 
      and Korea but not in the United States. We have isolated and characterized two 
      pathogenic reassortant MRV3 isolates from swine fecal samples from porcine 
      epidemic diarrhea outbreaks and ring-dried swine blood meal in the United States. 
      These fecal and blood meal isolates or a chloroform extract of blood meal induced 
      severe diarrhea and mortality in experimentally infected neonatal pigs. Genetic 
      and phylogenetic analyses of two MRV3 isolates revealed that they are identical 
      but differed significantly from nonpathogenic mammalian orthoreoviruses 
      circulating in the United States. The present study provides a platform for 
      immediate development of suitable vaccines and diagnostics to prevent and control 
      porcine orthoreovirus diarrhea.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus. 
      In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% 
      mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and 
      farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, 
      we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived 
      PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and 
      in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was 
      rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating 
      virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the 
      wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) 
      and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate 
      icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP. icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, 
      was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. 
      However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than 
      those in wild-type-virus- or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller 
      plaques than those of PC22A. Together, these data describe the development of a 
      robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate 
      pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key 
      infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live 
      attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting. IMPORTANCE: Porcine 
      epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged in the United States in 2013 and has since 
      killed 10% of U.S. farm pigs. Though the disease has been circulating 
      internationally for decades, the lack of a rapid reverse-genetics platform for 
      manipulating PEDV and identifying genetic factors that impact transmission and 
      virulence has hindered the study of this important agricultural disease. Here, we 
      present a DNA-based infectious-clone system that replicates the pathogenesis of 
      circulating U.S. strain PC22A both in vitro and in piglets. This infectious clone 
      can be used both to study the genetics, virulence, and transmission of PEDV 
      coronavirus and to inform the creation of a live attenuated PEDV vaccine.

AB  - Coronaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that infect mammals and birds. Bats 
      are reservoirs for several different coronaviruses in the Alphacoronavirus and 
      Betacoronavirus genera. They also appear to be the natural reservoir for the 
      ancestral viruses that generated the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we 
      detected coronavirus sequences in next-generation sequence data created from 
      Eonycteris spelaea faeces and urine. We also screened by PCR urine samples, 
      faecal samples and rectal swabs collected from six species of bats in Singapore 
      between 2011 and 2014, all of which were negative. The phylogenetic analysis 
      indicates this novel strain is most closely related to lineage D 
      Betacoronaviruses detected in a diverse range of bat species. This is the second 
      time that coronaviruses have been detected in cave nectar bats, but the first 
      coronavirus sequence data generated from this species. Bat species from which 
      this group of coronaviruses has been detected are widely distributed across SE 
      Asia, South Asia and Southern China. They overlap geographically, often share 
      roosting sites and have been witnessed to forage on the same plant. The addition 
      of sequence data from this group of viruses will allow us to better understand 
      coronavirus evolution and host specificity.

TI  - Crystal Structure of Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus Main Protease in Complex 
      with Synergetic Dual Inhibitors.
PG  - 1910-7
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02685-15 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause highly prevalent diseases in humans and animals. 
      Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, 
      resulting in a lethal systemic granulomatous disease called feline infectious 
      peritonitis (FIP), which is one of the most important fatal infectious diseases 
      of cats worldwide. No specific vaccines or drugs have been approved to treat FIP. 
      CoV main proteases (M(pro)s) play a pivotal role in viral transcription and 
      replication, making them an ideal target for drug development. Here, we report 
      the crystal structure of FIPV M(pro) in complex with dual inhibitors, a zinc ion 
      and a Michael acceptor. The complex structure elaborates a unique mechanism of 
      two distinct inhibitors synergizing to inactivate the protease, providing a 
      structural basis to design novel antivirals and suggesting the potential to take 
      advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against CoV-associated diseases. 
      IMPORTANCE: Coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest genome size among all RNA 
      viruses. CoV infection causes various diseases in humans and animals, including 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      (MERS). No approved specific drugs or vaccinations are available to treat their 
      infections. Here, we report a novel dual inhibition mechanism targeting CoV main 
      protease (M(pro)) from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which leads to 
      lethal systemic granulomatous disease in cats. M(pro), conserved across all CoV 
      genomes, is essential for viral replication and transcription. We demonstrated 
      that zinc ion and a Michael acceptor-based peptidomimetic inhibitor 
      synergistically inactivate FIPV M(pro). We also solved the structure of FIPV 
      M(pro) complexed with two inhibitors, delineating the structural view of a dual 
      inhibition mechanism. Our study provides new insight into the pharmaceutical 
      strategy against CoV M(pro) through using zinc as an adjuvant therapy to enhance 
      the efficacy of an irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitor.

TI  - [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)].
PG  - 1044-1051
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging infectious disease of 
      growing global importance, which has caused severe acute respiratory disease in 
      more than 1,700 people, resulting in almost 600 deaths. MERS is caused by a novel 
      betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). All cases of MERS have been linked through travel to 
      or residence in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are 
      considered natu- ral reservoirs for MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is mainly transmitted from 
      infected dromedary camels to human beings, and it is transmitted among human 
      beings by droplets, contact, and perhaps airborne spread. Both community-acquired 
      and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human 
      transmis- sion reported in the community. The largest known outbreak of MERS 
      outside the Arabian Peninsula oc- curred in the Republic of Korea in 2015, with 
      186 cases. The outbreak was associated with a traveler re- turning from the 
      Arabian Peninsula. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild 
      disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting 
      in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. MERS is 
      suspected in the presence of febrile acute respiratory illness and close contact 
      with MERS-CoV, and can be confirmed by the detection of viral nucleic acid 
      through RT-PCR or se- rology. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS; 
      however, the neutralizing antibodies, ribavirin and interferon have been shown to 
      be potentially useful anti-MERS-CoV drugs. Rigorous infection prevention and 
      control measures with droplet and contact precautions are crucial to prevent the 
      spread in health-care facilities. [Review].

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) first emerged in the United States in 2013 
      causing high mortality and morbidity in neonatal piglets with immense economic 
      losses to the swine industry. PEDV is an alpha-coronavirus replicating primarily 
      in porcine intestinal cells. PEDV vaccines are available in Asia and Europe, and 
      conditionally-licensed vaccines recently became available in the United States 
      but the efficacies of these vaccines in eliminating PEDV from swine populations 
      are questionable. In this study, the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on 
      the spike protein of PEDV, which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells 
      (DCs) expressing Langerin, was assessed. The PEDV S antigen was delivered to the 
      dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to Langerin and the 
      targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant. This approach, known 
      as "dendritic cell targeting," greatly improved PEDV S antigen-specific T cell 
      interferon-γ responses in the CD4(pos)CD8(pos) T cell compartment in pigs as 
      early as 7days upon transdermal administration. When the vaccine protein was 
      targeted to Langerin(pos) DCs systemically through intramuscular vaccination, it 
      induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses in pigs, though these responses 
      require a booster dose, and the magnitude of T cell responses were lower as 
      compared to transdermal vaccination. We conclude that PEDV spike protein domains 
      targeting Langerin-expressing dendritic cells significantly increased CD4 T cell 
      immune responses in pigs. The results indicate that the immunogenicity of protein 
      subunit vaccines can be greatly enhanced by direct targeting of the vaccine 
      antigens to desirable dendritic cell subsets in pigs.

AB  - Bats of different species play a major role in the emergence and transmission of 
      highly pathogenic viruses including Ebola virus, SARS-like coronavirus and the 
      henipaviruses. These viruses require proteolytic activation of surface envelope 
      glycoproteins needed for entry, and cellular cathepsins have been shown to be 
      involved in proteolysis of glycoproteins from these distinct virus families. Very 
      little is currently known about the available proteases in bats. To determine 
      whether the utilization of cathepsins by bat-borne viruses is related to the 
      nature of proteases in their natural hosts, we examined proteolytic processing of 
      several viral fusion proteins in cells derived from two fruit bat species, 
      Pteropus alecto and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our work shows that fruit bat cells 
      have homologs of cathepsin and furin proteases capable of cleaving and activating 
      both the cathepsin-dependent Hendra virus F and the furin-dependent parainfluenza 
      virus 5 F proteins. Sequence analysis comparing Pteropus alecto furin and 
      cathepsin L to proteases from other mammalian species showed a high degree of 
      conservation; however significant amino acid variation occurs at the C-terminus 
      of Pteropus alecto furin. Further analysis of furin-like proteases from fruit 
      bats revealed that these proteases are catalytically active and resemble other 
      mammalian furins in their response to a potent furin inhibitor. However, kinetic 
      analysis suggests that differences may exist in the cellular localization of 
      furin between different species. Collectively, these results indicate that the 
      unusual role of cathepsin proteases in the life cycle of bat-borne viruses is not 
      due to the lack of active furin-like proteases in these natural reservoir 
      species; however, differences may exist between furin proteases present in fruit 
      bats compared to furins in other mammalian species, and these differences may 
      impact protease usage for viral glycoprotein processing.

AB  - Entry of the α-coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) requires 
      specific proteases to activate spike (S) protein for the membrane fusion of the 
      virion to the host cell following receptor binding. Herein, PEDV isolate 85-7 
      could proliferate and induce cell-cell fusion in a trypsin independent manner on 
      Vero cells, and eight homologous mutation strains were screened by continuous 
      proliferation in the absence of trypsin on Vero cells. According to the whole 
      genome sequence comparative analysis, we identified four major variations located 
      in nonstructural protein 2, S, open reading frame 3, and envelope (E) genes, 
      respectively. Comparative analyses of their genomic variations and proliferation 
      characteristics identified a single mutation within the S2' cleavage site between 
      C30 and C40 mutants: the substitution of conserved arginine (R) by a glycine (G) 
      (R895G). This change resulted in weaker cell-cell fusion, smaller plaque 
      morphology, higher virus titer and serious microfilament condensation. Further 
      analysis confirmed that this mutation was responsible for optimal 
      cell-adaptation, but not the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV. 
      Otherwise, a novel variation (16-20 aa deletion and an L25P mutation) in the 
      transmembrane domain of the E protein affected multiple infection processes, 
      including up-regulation of the production of the ER stress indicator GRP78, 
      improving the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and 
      promoting apoptosis. The results of this study provide a better understanding of 
      the potential mechanisms of viral functional proteins in PEDV replication, 
      infection, and fitness.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has caused huge economic losses to the global 
      pork industry. Infection by its causative agent PED virus (PEDV), an 
      Alpha-coronavirus, was previously proven to be mediated by its spike (S) 
      glycoprotein and a cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN). 
      Interestingly, some recent studies have indicated that pAPN is not a functional 
      receptor for PEDV. To date, there is a lack of a direct evidence for the 
      interaction between pAPN and PEDV S protein in vitro. Here, we prepared pAPN 
      ectodomain and the truncated variants of PEDV S protein in Drosophila S2 cells. 
      These recombinant proteins were homogeneous after purification by metal-affinity 
      and size-exclusion chromatography. We then assayed the purified target proteins 
      through immunogenicity tests, PEDV binding interference assays, circular 
      dichroism (CD) measurements, pAPN activity assay and structural determination, 
      demonstrating that they were biologically functional. Finally, we characterized 
      their interactions by gel filtration chromatography, native-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis (PAGE) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. The results 
      showed that their affinities were too low to form complexes, which suggest that 
      pAPN may be controversial as the genuine receptor for PEDV. Therefore, further 
      research needs to be carried out to elucidate the interaction between PEDV and 
      its genuine receptor.

TI  - Further Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00373-17 [doi]
LID - e00373-17
AB  - The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV) are unknown. Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are 
      likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from 
      various species in the family Vespertilionidae Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV 
      identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain 
      PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the 
      evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
      PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, 
      consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly 
      divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have 
      different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions 
      were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block 
      PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally 
      test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the 
      PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from 
      the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new 
      infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings 
      suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat. 
      Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary 
      mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the 
      critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.IMPORTANCE 
      Global surveillance efforts for undiscovered viruses are an important component 
      of pandemic prevention initiatives. These surveys can be useful for finding novel 
      viruses and for gaining insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors 
      driving viral diversity; however, finding a viral sequence is not sufficient to 
      determine whether it can infect people (i.e., poses a zoonotic threat). Here, we 
      investigated the specific zoonotic risk of a MERS-like coronavirus 
      (PREDICT/PDF-2180) identified in a bat from Uganda and showed that, despite being 
      closely related to MERS-CoV, it is unlikely to pose a threat to humans. We 
      suggest that this approach constitutes an appropriate strategy for beginning to 
      determine the zoonotic potential of wildlife viruses. By showing that 
      PREDICT/PDF-2180 does not infect cells that express the functional receptor for 
      MERS-CoV, we further show that recombination was likely to be the critical step 
      that allowed MERS to emerge in humans.

TI  - Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in Europe: In-Detail Analyses of Disease Dynamics and 
      Molecular Epidemiology.
LID - 10.3390/v9070177 [doi]
LID - 177
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease 
      of swine caused by the eponymous virus (PEDV) which belongs to the genus 
      Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae virus family. Following the disastrous 
      outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. 
      In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, 
      and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples 
      from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other 
      European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total 
      of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a 
      global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe 
      formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent 
      re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and 
      putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations 
      between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be 
      established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using 
      the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no 
      correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV 
      genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were 
      reconstructed each representing new virus strains. In detail, three pasivirus A 
      strains, two astroviruses, a porcine sapelovirus, a kobuvirus, a porcine 
      torovirus, a posavirus, and an enterobacteria phage were almost fully sequenced.

TI  - Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acids via a 
      conserved receptor-binding site in spike protein domain A.
PG  - 2681-2690
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1809667116 [doi]
AB  - Human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are endemic respiratory pathogens and, 
      while related, originated from independent zoonotic introductions. OC43 is in 
      fact a host-range variant of the species Betacoronavirus-1, and more closely 
      related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-its presumptive ancestor-and porcine 
      hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). The β1-coronaviruses (β1CoVs) 
      and HKU1 employ glycan-based receptors carrying 9-O-acetylated sialic acid 
      (9-O-Ac-Sia). Receptor binding is mediated by spike protein S, the main 
      determinant of coronavirus host specificity. For BCoV, a crystal structure for 
      the receptor-binding domain S1(A) is available and for HKU1 a cryoelectron 
      microscopy structure of the complete S ectodomain. However, the location of the 
      receptor-binding site (RBS), arguably the single-most important piece of 
      information, is unknown. Here we solved the 3.0-Å crystal structure of PHEV S1(A) 
      We then took a comparative structural analysis approach to map the β1CoV S RBS, 
      using the general design of 9-O-Ac-Sia-binding sites as blueprint, backed-up by 
      automated ligand docking, structure-guided mutagenesis of OC43, BCoV, and PHEV 
      S1(A), and infectivity assays with BCoV-S-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis 
      viruses. The RBS is not exclusive to OC43 and related animal viruses, but is 
      apparently conserved and functional also in HKU1 S1(A) The binding affinity of 
      the HKU1 S RBS toward short sialoglycans is significantly lower than that of 
      OC43, which we attribute to differences in local architecture and accessibility, 
      and which may be indicative for differences between the two viruses in receptor 
      fine-specificity. Our findings challenge reports that would map the OC43 RBS 
      elsewhere in S1(A) and that of HKU1 in domain S1(B).

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel 
      betacoronavirus that has been circulating in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 and 
      causing severe respiratory infections in humans. While bats were suggested to be 
      involved in human MERS-CoV infections, a direct link between bats and MERS-CoV is 
      uncertain. On the other hand, serological and virological data suggest dromedary 
      camels as the potential animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV. Recently, we isolated 
      MERS-CoV from a camel and its infected owner and provided evidence for the direct 
      transmission of MERS-CoV from the infected camel to the patient. Here, we extend 
      this work and show that identical MERS-CoV RNA fragments were detected in an air 
      sample collected from the same barn that sheltered the infected camel in our 
      previous study. These data indicate that the virus was circulating in this farm 
      concurrently with its detection in the camel and in the patient, which warrants 
      further investigations for the possible airborne transmission of MERS-CoV. 
      Importance: This work clearly highlights the importance of continuous 
      surveillance and infection control measures to control the global public threat 
      of MERS-CoV. While current MERS-CoV transmission appears to be limited, we advise 
      minimal contact with camels, especially for immunocompromised individuals, and 
      the use of appropriate health, safety, and infection prevention and control 
      measures when dealing with infected patients. Also, detailed clinical histories 
      of any MERS-CoV cases with epidemiological and laboratory investigations carried 
      out for any animal exposure must be considered to identify any animal source.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the alphacoronavirus of the 
      Coronaviridae. It is the major etiological agent of the recent outbreaks of 
      piglet diarrhea and death in the US. Limited knowledge is currently available 
      regarding the role of dendritic cells in PEDV infection. Here, we observed that 
      PEDV did not replicate in monocyte-derived dendritic cells as evidenced by the 
      decrease of viral gene transcript copies in infected cells by qRT-PCR and the 
      absence of viral proteins by immunofluorescence staining as well as the absence 
      of virus particles in infected cells by transmission electron microscopy. In 
      addition, PEDV did not compromise cell viability at 48, 72, and 96h after 
      infection at either a MOI of 2.5 or 5. Interestingly, an increased transcription 
      of type I interferon including interferon-α and β was observed in infected cells 
      compared to mock infected cells. Surprisingly, we did not detect any interferon-β 
      in the supernatants of infected cells. A slight increase in interferon-α protein 
      production in the supernatants of PEDV-infected cells was observed compared to 
      mock infected cells. We also observed a markedly increased transcription of 
      interferon inducible protein -10 (IP-10). Overall, PEDV does not replicate in 
      porcine Mo-DC, but activates the transcription of type I interferon and chemokine 
      IP-10.

TI  - Seasonal Fluctuations of Astrovirus, But Not Coronavirus Shedding in Bats 
      Inhabiting Human-Modified Tropical Forests.
PG  - 272-284
LID - 10.1007/s10393-017-1245-x [doi]
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are considered a major threat to global 
      health. Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and 
      humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat 
      deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife 
      species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious 
      agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to 
      host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a 
      paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat 
      disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat 
      species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not 
      associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, 
      we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be 
      coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more 
      risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of 
      astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. 
      Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a 
      higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of 
      risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in 
      increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from 
      bats to other animals, including humans.

TI  - Transcriptome Profiling of the Virus-Induced Innate Immune Response in Pteropus 
      vampyrus and Its Attenuation by Nipah Virus Interferon Antagonist Functions.
PG  - 7550-66
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00302-15 [doi]
AB  - Bats are important reservoirs for several viruses, many of which cause lethal 
      infections in humans but have reduced pathogenicity in bats. As the innate immune 
      response is critical for controlling viruses, the nature of this response in bats 
      and how it may differ from that in other mammals are of great interest. Using 
      next-generation transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq), we profiled the 
      transcriptional response of Pteropus vampyrus bat kidney (PVK) cells to Newcastle 
      disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus known to elicit a strong innate 
      immune response in mammalian cells. The Pteropus genus is a known reservoir of 
      Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Analysis of the 200 to 300 regulated 
      genes showed that genes for interferon (IFN) and antiviral pathways are highly 
      upregulated in NDV-infected PVK cells, including genes for beta IFN, RIG-I, MDA5, 
      ISG15, and IRF1. NDV-infected cells also upregulated several genes not previously 
      characterized to be antiviral, such as RND1, SERTAD1, CHAC1, and MORC3. In fact, 
      we show that MORC3 is induced by both IFN and NDV infection in PVK cells but is 
      not induced by either stimulus in human A549 cells. In contrast to NDV infection, 
      HeV and NiV infection of PVK cells failed to induce these innate immune response 
      genes. Likewise, an attenuated response was observed in PVK cells infected with 
      recombinant NDVs expressing the NiV IFN antagonist proteins V and W. This study 
      provides the first global profile of a robust virus-induced innate immune 
      response in bats and indicates that henipavirus IFN antagonist mechanisms are 
      likely active in bat cells. IMPORTANCE: Bats are the reservoir host for many 
      highly pathogenic human viruses, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses, and many other viruses 
      have also been isolated from bats. Viral infections are reportedly asymptomatic 
      or heavily attenuated in bat populations. Despite their ecological importance to 
      viral maintenance, research into their immune system and mechanisms for viral 
      control has only recently begun. Nipah virus and Hendra virus are two 
      paramyxoviruses associated with high mortality rates in humans and whose 
      reservoir is the Pteropus genus of bats. Greater knowledge of the innate immune 
      response of P. vampyrus bats to viral infection may elucidate how bats serve as a 
      reservoir for so many viruses.

TI  - Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new 
      insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.

AB  - A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in 
      horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China. However, these bat 
      SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 
      different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the 
      direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year 
      surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe 
      bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered 
      SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the 
      SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, 
      ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in 
      the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 
      the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this 
      cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar 
      to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV 
      strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the 
      non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. 
      Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the 
      S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the 
      direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination 
      events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies 
      demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein 
      sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the 
      close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides 
      new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the 
      necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.

      Betacoronavirus HKU1.

AB  - Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins mediate receptor binding, membrane fusion, 
      and virus entry and determine host range. Murine betacoronavirus (β-CoV) in group 
      A uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein to bind to its receptor, whereas 
      the β-CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV in group B and Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome CoV in group C and several α-CoVs use the downstream C 
      domain in their S proteins to recognize their receptor proteins. To identify the 
      receptor-binding domain in the spike of human β-CoV HKU1 in group A, we generated 
      and mapped a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the ectodomain of HKU1 
      spike protein. They did not cross-react with S proteins of any other CoV tested. 
      Most of the HKU1 spike MAbs recognized epitopes in the C domain between amino 
      acids 535 and 673, indicating that this region is immunodominant. Two of the MAbs 
      blocked HKU1 virus infection of primary human tracheal-bronchial epithelial 
      (HTBE) cells. Preincubation of HTBE cells with a truncated HKU1 S protein that 
      includes the C domain blocked infection with HKU1 virus, but preincubation of 
      cells with truncated S protein containing only the NTD did not block infection. 
      These data suggest that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HKU1 spike protein 
      is located in the C domain, where the spike proteins of α-CoVs and β-CoVs in 
      groups B and C bind to their specific receptor proteins. Thus, two β-CoVs in 
      group A, HKU1 and murine CoV, have evolved to use different regions of their 
      spike glycoproteins to recognize their respective receptor proteins. IMPORTANCE: 
      Mouse hepatitis virus, a β-CoV in group A, uses the galectin-like NTD in its 
      spike protein to bind its receptor protein, while HCoV-OC43, another β-CoV in 
      group A, uses the NTD to bind to its sialic-acid containing receptor. In marked 
      contrast, the NTD of the spike glycoprotein of human respiratory β-CoV HKU1, 
      which is also in group A, does not bind sugar. In this study, we showed that for 
      the spike protein of HKU1, the purified C domain, downstream of the NTD, could 
      block HKU1 virus infection of human respiratory epithelial cells, and that 
      several monoclonal antibodies that mapped to the C domain neutralized virus 
      infectivity. Thus, the receptor-binding domain of HKU1 spike glycoprotein is 
      located in the C domain. Surprisingly, two β-CoVs in group A, mouse hepatitis 
      virus and HKU1, have evolved to use different regions of their spike 
      glycoproteins to recognize their respective receptors.

TI  - Antiviral potential of ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling modulation for Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection as identified by temporal kinome 
      analysis.
PG  - 1088-99
LID - 10.1128/AAC.03659-14 [doi]
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lineage C 
      betacoronavirus, and infections with this virus can result in acute respiratory 
      syndrome with renal failure. Globally, MERS-CoV has been responsible for 877 
      laboratory-confirmed infections, including 317 deaths, since September 2012. As 
      there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular pathogenesis associated 
      with this virus or the identities of novel antiviral drug targets, we performed 
      temporal kinome analysis on human hepatocytes infected with the Erasmus isolate 
      of MERS-CoV with peptide kinome arrays. bioinformatics analysis of our kinome 
      data, including pathway overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and functional network 
      analysis, suggested that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase 
      (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      signaling responses were specifically modulated in response to MERS-CoV infection 
      in vitro throughout the course of infection. The overrepresentation of specific 
      intermediates within these pathways determined by pathway and functional network 
      analysis of our kinome data correlated with similar patterns of phosphorylation 
      determined through Western blot array analysis. In addition, analysis of the 
      effects of specific kinase inhibitors on MERS-CoV infection in tissue culture 
      models confirmed these cellular response observations. Further, we have 
      demonstrated that a subset of licensed kinase inhibitors targeting the ERK/MAPK 
      and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways significantly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in vitro 
      whether they were added before or after viral infection. Taken together, our data 
      suggest that ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles 
      in MERS-CoV infection and may represent novel drug targets for therapeutic 
      intervention strategies.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in 
      the family Coronaviridae and causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and 
      high mortality in seronegative newborn piglets. Thus, a precise and rapid 
      diagnosis of PEDV infection is important for the application of control measures 
      to limit viral dissemination. In this investigation, a monoclonal antibodies 
      (MAbs)-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting 
      antibodies against PEDV was developed and validated. The diagnostic performance 
      of the test was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
      using a panel of 829 known sera collected from different commercial pig farms, 
      with or without a history of PED presence and from experimentally infected pigs. 
      The competitive ELISA showed excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory 
      power with high sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values (Se = 96.5%, 95% IC 
      94.1-98.1; Sp = 98.2%, 95% IC 96.3-99.3). Moreover, this competitive ELISA method 
      has other properties, such as high feasibility of testing sera without 
      pre-treatment and automatic and instrument-mediated revealing, that makes it 
      appropriate for large-scale screenings of affected pig farms in endemic regions 
      or for monitoring plans in PEDV-free areas.

TI  - Permissivity of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Orthologs to Middle East Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus Is Governed by Glycosylation and Other Complex Determinants.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00534-17 [doi]
LID - e00534-17
AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) utilizes dipeptidyl 
      peptidase 4 (DPP4) as an entry receptor. While bat, camel, and human DPP4 support 
      MERS-CoV infection, several DPP4 orthologs, including mouse, ferret, hamster, and 
      guinea pig DPP4, do not. Previous work revealed that glycosylation of mouse DPP4 
      plays a role in blocking MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested whether 
      glycosylation also acts as a determinant of permissivity for ferret, hamster, and 
      guinea pig DPP4. We found that, while glycosylation plays an important role in 
      these orthologs, additional sequence and structural determinants impact their 
      ability to act as functional receptors for MERS-CoV. These results provide 
      insight into DPP4 species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range and 
      better inform our understanding of virus-receptor interactions associated with 
      disease emergence and host susceptibility.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV is a recently 
      emerged zoonotic virus that is still circulating in the human population with an 
      ∼35% mortality rate. With no available vaccines or therapeutics, the study of 
      MERS-CoV pathogenesis is crucial for its control and prevention. However, in vivo 
      studies are limited because MERS-CoV cannot infect wild-type mice due to 
      incompatibilities between the virus spike and the mouse host cell receptor, mouse 
      DPP4 (mDPP4). Specifically, mDPP4 has a nonconserved glycosylation site that acts 
      as a barrier to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, one mouse model strategy has been to 
      modify the mouse genome to remove this glycosylation site. Here, we investigated 
      whether glycosylation acts as a barrier to infection for other nonpermissive 
      small-animal species, namely, ferret, guinea pig, and hamster. Understanding the 
      virus-receptor interactions for these DPP4 orthologs will help in the development 
      of additional animal models while also revealing species-specific differences 
      impacting MERS-CoV host range.

TI  - Two critical N-terminal epitopes of the nucleocapsid protein contribute to the 
      cross-reactivity between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine 
      transmissible gastroenteritis virus.
PG  - 206-216
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.001216 [doi]
AB  - Both porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and porcine transmissible 
      gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which cause high mortality in piglets and produce 
      similar clinical symptoms and histopathological morphology, belong to the genus 
      Alphacoronavirus. Serological diagnosis plays an important role in distinguishing 
      pathogen species. Together with the spike (S) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) 
      protein is one of the immunodominant regions among coronaviruses. In this study, 
      two-way antigenic cross-reactivity between the N proteins of PEDV and TGEV was 
      observed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. 
      Furthermore, the PEDV N protein harbouring truncations of amino acids (aa) 1 to 
      170 or aa 125 to 301 was demonstrated to cross-react with the anti-TGEV N 
      polyclonal antibody (PAb), whereas the truncation-expressing aa 302 to 401 
      resulted in a specific reaction with the anti-PEDV N PAb but not with the 
      anti-TGEV N PAb. Mutants of the PEDV N protein were generated based on sequence 
      alignment and structural analysis; we then confirmed that the N-terminal residues 
      58-RWRMRRGERIE-68 and 78-LGTGPHAD-85 contributed to the cross-reactivity. All the 
      results provide vital clues for the development of precise diagnostic assays for 
      porcine coronaviruses.

      3-7-year-old gnotobiotic calves orally inoculated with porcine deltacoronavirus 
      (PDCoV) (9.0-9.6 log(10) genomic equivalents [GE] of OH-FD22-P5; n=4) or porcine 
      epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (10.2-12.5 log(10) GE of PC21A; n=3). In

      PDCoV-specific serum IgG antibody responses were observed, but without lesions or 
      clinical disease. However, no fecal shedding, seroconversion, histological 
      lesions, and clinical disease were detected in PEDV-inoculated calves. Our data 
      indicate that calves are susceptible to infection by the newly emerged PDCoV, but

TI  - Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus WIV1 Encodes an Extra 
      Accessory Protein, ORFX, Involved in Modulation of the Host Immune Response.
PG  - 6573-6582
LID - 10.1128/JVI.03079-15 [doi]
AB  - Bats harbor severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) 
      from which the causative agent of the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic is thought to have 
      originated. However, despite the fact that a large number of genetically diverse 
      SL-CoV sequences have been detected in bats, only two strains (named WIV1 and 
      WIV16) have been successfully cultured in vitro These two strains differ from 
      SARS-CoV only in containing an extra open reading frame (ORF) (named ORFX), 
      between ORF6 and ORF7, which has no homology to any known protein sequences. In 
      this study, we constructed a full-length cDNA clone of SL-CoV WIV1 (rWIV1), an 
      ORFX deletion mutant (rWIV1-ΔX), and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing 
      mutant (rWIV1-GFP-ΔX). Northern blotting and fluorescence microscopy indicate 
      that ORFX was expressed during WIV1 infection. A virus infection assay showed 
      that rWIV1-ΔX replicated as efficiently as rWIV1 in Vero E6, Calu-3, and 
      HeLa-hACE2 cells. Further study showed that ORFX could inhibit interferon 
      production and activate NF-κB. Our results demonstrate for the first time that 
      the unique ORFX in the WIV1 strain is a functional gene involving modulation of 
      the host immune response but is not essential for in vitro viral replication. 
      IMPORTANCE: Bats harbor genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), 
      and some of them have the potential for interspecies transmission. A unique open 
      reading frame (ORFX) was identified in the genomes of two recently isolated bat 
      SL-CoV strains (WIV1 and -16). It will therefore be critical to clarify whether 
      and how this protein contributes to virulence during viral infection. Here we 
      revealed that the unique ORFX is a functional gene that is involved in the 
      modulation of the host immune response but is not essential for in vitro viral 
      replication. Our results provide important information for further exploration of 
      the ORFX function in the future. Moreover, the reverse genetics system we 
      constructed will be helpful for study of the pathogenesis of this group of 
      viruses and to develop therapeutics for future control of emerging SARS-like 
      infections.

TI  - Association of host tropism of Middle East syndrome coronavirus with the amino 
      acid structure of host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - The Middle East syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently emerging 
      betacoronavirus with high fatality. Recently, dipeptidyle peptidase (CD26, DPP4) 
      was identified as the host cell receptor for MERS-CoV. Interestingly, despite of 
      common presence of DPP4 receptors the binding and infection of various cells 
      shows imminent variability. In this report, we provide a tool for prediction of 
      the host tropism of the virus based on the host receptor binding interface. We 
      found out that, in the binding of MERS-CoV to cells the amino acid residues in 
      lancets 4 and 5 of DPP4 receptor, namely K267, Q286, T288, R317, R336, Q344 A291, 
      L294, and I295 are involved. Changes in these residues correspond to profound 
      decrease in virus binding to cells. The nine residues at the interface between 
      the virus spikes and the lancets 4 and 5 of host DPP4 can be used as a predictive 
      tool for the host tropism and virus affinity to host cell receptors.

AB  - Understanding viral transmission dynamics within populations of reservoir hosts 
      can facilitate greater knowledge of the spillover of emerging infectious 
      diseases. While bat-borne viruses are of concern to public health, investigations 
      into their dynamics have been limited by a lack of longitudinal data from 
      individual bats. Here, we examine capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from a 
      species of Australian bat (Myotis macropus) infected with a putative novel 
      Alphacoronavirus within a Bayesian framework. Then, we developed epidemic models 
      to estimate the effect of persistently infectious individuals (which shed viruses 
      for extensive periods) on the probability of viral maintenance within the study 
      population. We found that the CMR data analysis supported grouping of infectious 
      bats into persistently and transiently infectious bats. Maintenance of 
      coronavirus within the study population was more likely in an epidemic model that 
      included both persistently and transiently infectious bats, compared with the 
      epidemic model with non-grouping of bats. These findings, using rare CMR data 
      from longitudinal samples of individual bats, increase our understanding of 
      transmission dynamics of bat viral infectious diseases.

TI  - Enhanced inflammation in New Zealand white rabbits when MERS-CoV reinfection 
      occurs in the absence of neutralizing antibody.

AB  - The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic 
      betacoronavirus that was first detected in humans in 2012 as a cause of severe 
      acute respiratory disease. As of July 28, 2017, there have been 2,040 confirmed 
      cases with 712 reported deaths. While many infections have been fatal, there have 
      also been a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases discovered through 
      monitoring and contact tracing. New Zealand white rabbits are a possible model 
      for asymptomatic infection with MERS-CoV. In order to discover more about 
      non-lethal infections and to learn whether a single infection with MERS-CoV would 
      protect against reinfection, we inoculated rabbits with MERS-CoV and monitored 
      the antibody and inflammatory response. Following intranasal infection, rabbits 
      developed a transient dose-dependent pulmonary infection with moderately high 
      levels of viral RNA, viral antigen, and perivascular inflammation in multiple 
      lung lobes that was not associated with clinical signs. The rabbits developed 
      antibodies against viral proteins that lacked neutralizing activity and the 
      animals were not protected from reinfection. In fact, reinfection resulted in 
      enhanced pulmonary inflammation, without an associated increase in viral RNA 
      titers. Interestingly, passive transfer of serum from previously infected rabbits 
      to naïve rabbits was associated with enhanced inflammation upon infection. We 
      further found this inflammation was accompanied by increased recruitment of 
      complement proteins compared to primary infection. However, reinfection elicited 
      neutralizing antibodies that protected rabbits from subsequent viral challenge. 
      Our data from the rabbit model suggests that people exposed to MERS-CoV who fail 
      to develop a neutralizing antibody response, or persons whose neutralizing 
      antibody titers have waned, may be at risk for severe lung disease on re-exposure 
      to MERS-CoV.

TI  - Structure of interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from the bat species 
      Myotis davidii and the impact of interdomain ISG15 interactions on viral protein 
      engagement.
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1107/S2059798318015322 [doi]
AB  - Bats have long been observed to be the hosts and the origin of numerous human 
      diseases. Bats, like all mammals, rely on a number of innate immune mechanisms to 
      combat invading pathogens, including the interferon type I, II and III responses. 
      Ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is a key modulator 
      of these interferon responses. Within these pathways, ISG15 can serve to 
      stabilize host proteins modulating innate immune responses and act as a cytokine. 
      Post-translational modifications of viral proteins introduced by ISG15 have also 
      been observed to directly affect the function of numerous viral proteins. Unlike 
      ubiquitin, which is virtually identical across all animals, comparison of ISG15s 
      across species reveals that they are relatively divergent, with sequence identity 
      dropping to as low as ∼58% among mammals. In addition to serving as an obstacle 
      to the zoonotic transmission of influenza, these ISG15 species-species 
      differences have also long been shown to have an impact on the function of viral 
      deISGylases. Recently, the structure of the first nonhuman ISG15, originating 
      from mouse, suggested that the structures of human ISG15 may not be reflective of 
      other species. Here, the structure of ISG15 from the bat species Myotis davidii 
      solved to 1.37 Å resolution is reported. Comparison of this ISG15 structure with 
      those from human and mouse not only underscores the structural impact of ISG15 
      species-species differences, but also highlights a conserved hydrophobic motif 
      formed between the two domains of ISG15. Using the papain-like deISGylase from 
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a probe, the biochemical 
      importance of this motif in ISG15-protein engagements was illuminated.

AB  - In 2012, a new betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
      (MERS-CoV), was identified in humans. Several studies confirmed dromedary camels 
      to be a potential reservoir and a source for human infection. Camels located on 
      the Canary Islands were included in those studies and ca 10% of them were 
      positive for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. However, these findings could not be 
      correctly interpreted because epidemiological information was not provided. Thus, 
      further investigations were necessary to clarify these results. A total of 170 
      camels were investigated in this survey, of which seven (4.1%) were seropositive 
      by ELISA. Epidemiological information revealed that all seropositive camels had 
      been imported from Africa 20 or more years prior. We conclude that seropositive 
      camels had contact with MERS-CoV in Africa and that there is no shedding of the 
      virus among camels or people around the farms on the Canary Islands. However, the 
      presence of antibodies in the camel herds should be monitored.

AB  - Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was recently identified 
      as a novel human coronavirus known to infect human with high mortality. It 
      belongs to C clade of the betacoronavirus shown the similar genomic structure as 
      other human coronaviruses.To date, some different subtypes of the viral genome 
      were identified but its origin was unclear. Some evidences indicated it maybe 
      came from the bats or dromedary. And series of molecular detection methods have 
      been established and applied in lab and clinic.
